    "section": "Pressure in Static Fluids",
    "text": "Pressure in Static Fluids\nPressure (\\(P\\)) is defined as:\n\\[P = \\frac{F}{A}\\]\nThis gives \\(P\\) the dimensions \\([M LT^{-2} L^{-2}]\\) or ‚Äî more simply ‚Äî \\([M L^{-1} T^{-2}]\\).\nConsider a liquid in a container in which there is no submerged object. In such a system the pressure at a given point can be calculated as:\n\\[P = \\rho g h\\]\nThe \\(\\rho\\) corresponds to the density of the liquid and \\(h\\) the height from the surface. As usual, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions Check\n\n\n\nDoes the second equation above yield the dimensions you expect?\n\n\nThe equation should ring true intuitively if you have ever experienced the increase in pressure when diving deeper into water. Nonetheless, it is counter-intuitive to many that it is merely the height (and not the volume) of water that determines the pressure. In practice, this means that very narrow columns of fluid can generate enormous pressures if the column is high enough (the hydrostatic paradox).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition Behind the Pressure Equation\n\n\n\nIntuitively we have some notion that \\(P\\) is associated with the weight \\(W\\) of liquid. So we might expect (wrongly) that\n\\[P = W\\]\nHowever, this cannot be correct because weight is a force not a pressure. So we might write:\n\\[F = W\\]\nThis is correct, but does not seem to tell us what we want to know, which is how to calculate \\(P\\). Now, to move forward we need to first consider that \\(\\frac{F}{A} = P\\), so we know that we need to ultimately divide our \\(F\\) value by an area (\\(A\\)) value. Obviously, there is no \\(A\\) value on the right-side of the equation, so we need to find one. To do this we consider that \\(W = m.a\\) and in the liquid column the acceleration is due to gravity:\n\\[F = m.g\\]\nNext, we recognise that \\(m = œÅV\\), so that:\n\\[F = œÅ.V.g\\]\nRemember, we would like to find an \\(A\\) value on the right side, so where is it? Well, consider that the dimensions of \\(V\\) are \\(L^3\\), which can be the product of an area with dimensions \\(L^2\\) and a length (\\(l\\)) with dimensions \\(L\\). So we can re-write the equation as:\n\\[F = œÅ.A.l.g\\]\nThe \\(A\\) value must refer to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (i.e., a circle), while the \\(l\\) value must refer to the height (\\(h\\)) of liquid. The volume of a cylinder is the product of the cross-sectional area by its height. Now, we can replace \\(l\\) by \\(h\\) and divide both sides by \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = P = œÅ.h.g\\]"

    "section": "Pressure Head",
    "text": "Pressure Head\nThere is one simple way of re-arranging the equation for hydrostatic pressure that is important to note. If both sides of the equation are divided by the product of \\(\\rho\\) and \\(g\\) then we get the following:\n\\[h = \\frac{P}{\\rho g}\\]\nThis is known as the ‚Äúpressure head‚Äù and tells us the height of a column of liquid that can be supported by a given pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf atmospheric pressure is \\(101325 \\ kg \\ m^{-1} \\ s^{-2}\\), \\(g\\) is \\(9.81 \\ m \\ s^{-2}\\) and the density of water is \\(1000 \\ kg \\ m^{-3}\\), estimate the height of a column of water that can be supported at atmospheric pressure.\nAssume that\n\\[h = \\frac{P}{\\rho g}\\]\nPlugging in values:\n\\[h = \\frac{101325}{1000 \\cdot 9.81}\\]\n\\(h = 10.3 \\ m\\)\nThus, the tendency of a column of liquid of a specific height to be supported by liquid at a specific pressure allows height (or ‚Äúpressure head‚Äù) to be used as an index of pressure. The greater the pressure the greater the height. This is the basis of traditional barometers used to measure pressure, where a more dense liquid (e.g., mercury) is used to ensure that the barometer does not need to be excessively large as an instrument (can you tell from the equation why this is so?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will encounter pressure head again when looking at Bernoulli‚Äôs equation, so you may need to return to these notes."

    "section": "Absolute and Gauge Pressure",
    "text": "Absolute and Gauge Pressure\nIn the tour of the processing facilities at UCC several pressure gauges were shown. These gauges were reading \\(0 \\ bar\\), yet atmospheric pressure is approximately \\(1 \\ bar\\). If the pressure was really zero then the processing facility would be in a vacuum.\nThe simple reason for this is that these pressure gauges do not give a readout of absolute pressure. Instead, they provide what is known as gauge pressure.\nGauge pressure is simply the pressure of the system minus the atmospheric pressure. Hence, if you want to convert a gauge pressure to absolute pressure you add the atmospheric pressure.\nFor example, the (gauge) pressure at the bottom of a tank of liquid is given by \\(P = \\rho g h\\) but to calculate the absolute pressure (\\(P_A\\)) we would use \\(P_A = P_S + \\rho g h\\), where \\(P_S\\) is the pressure acting on the surface of the liquid (atmospheric).\nIt is important to note that this distinction does not matter when it comes to pressure drop. To make sense of this statement, please review the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure drop\n\n\n\nConsider a pipe through which a liquid is flowing from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure. The first gauge reads \\(2.0 \\ bar\\) and the second gauge reads \\(1.5 \\ bar\\). The pressure drop is therefore \\(2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \\ bar\\).\nNow consider the same calculation, but this time we convert any gauge pressure into an absolute pressure by adding \\(1.0 \\ bar\\):\n\\[(2.0 + 1.0) - (1.5 + 1.0) = 0.5 \\ bar\\]\nAs you can see, when determining pressure drop (often what we are interested in) this distinction is unimportant."

    "text": "From Static to Movement\nFluid statics concerns the state of fluids ‚Äúat rest‚Äù (not moving); however, as we saw in the example of Stoke‚Äôs law, we usually use these static systems is simplified models that help us understand more complex (moving) systems. So, while pressure can be created in a static liquid, we need to consider how this pressure can ultimately impact motion.\nA tank containing a liquid will exert pressure on the walls of the tank. The pressure will be greatest the deeper we dive below the surface. Place a pressure gauge just below the surface and one just above the bottom and there will be a difference in pressure.\nNow imagine there is a hole at the bottom of the tank. The pressure of the water inside the tank is high; however, the pressure outside the hole is the atmospheric pressure. As the pressure at the bottom of the tank is greater than the atmospheric pressure there will be a pressure drop from inside to outside.\nThis will also be true if we connect a pipe to the hole. The pressure at the start of the pipe is the pressure due to the depth of liquid (high), while the pressure at the end of the pipe is the pressure due to the atmosphere (low).\nAs you might expect, liquid will flow through the pipe, with the rate of flow determined by the pressure drop. While not a ‚Äúpump‚Äù in the classic sense, this is the simplest model of a pump we can think of. To get liquid to flow from one location to another we need a pressure drop. Here, the pressure drop is created due to the height of the liquid above an outlet.\nSeveral questions can be raised at this point:\n\nTo what extent does pressure drop determine flow-rate?\nHow does viscosity influence flow-rate?\nWhich pressure gauges are avaiable and how should they be selected?\n\nTo answer some of these questions we will again need to shift slightly between statics and dynamics before focusing on dynamics in a dedicated way."

For the mass to get from one point to another will take a certain time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn themselves, each of these quantities is obviously of practical importance.\nA mass indicates the amount of material that can be used, has to be handled, can be sold and so on. A length suggests how much space is required or available. A time determines how quickly something must be done.\n\n\nThese are three different quantities, each with their own dimension (in square brackets):\n\nMass: \\([M]\\)\nLength: \\([L]\\)\nTime: \\([T]\\)\n\nThese dimensions are fundamental, as they can be used to generate derived dimensions. For example, multiplying a length by itself gives an area \\([L^2]\\), and multiplying an area by a length gives a volume \\([L^3]\\). Dividing a mass by a volume gives a density \\([M L^{-3}]\\). Dividing a length by a time gives a velocity \\([L T^{-1}]\\).\nNote, the dimensional formula for density \\(M L^{-3}\\) corresponds to the equation for density (\\(\\rho\\)):\n\\[\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\\]\nAs \\(V\\) is below the line (i.e., in the ‚Äúdenominator‚Äù) we write its dimensions as \\(L^{-3}\\) rather than \\(L^3\\). It might sometimes be convenient to write dimensions as \\(\\frac{[M]}{[L^3]}\\) but this gets confusing for more complex formulas.

However, it can also be written on a single line in a form where the method to cancel units is more obvious:\n\\[[M LT^{-2}]{[L^{-2}}]\\]\nWe can then cancel the two length \\([L]\\) terms to \\([L^{-1}]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \\([L]\\) could also be written \\([L^1]\\).\nIt is usually not necessary, but this might help you understand the cancellation.\n\n\n\nSo in this case \\([L^1][L^{-2}] = [L^{1+(-2)}] = [L^{-1}]\\), which leaves the simpler formula:\n\\[[M L^{-1} T^{-2}]\\]\nFrom this it can be determined that the units are: \\(kg \\ m^{-1} \\ s^{-2}\\).

One advantage of being able to derive dimensions like this is immediately obvious. Instead of needing to remember the equation for pressure and the units of pressure you simply need to remember the equation and then you can derive the units when you need.\nWhile it is common and convenient to use units like Newtons and Pascals, I advise against relying on them unless you understand first how to derive/express units using \\(kg\\), \\(m\\) and \\(s\\)."
