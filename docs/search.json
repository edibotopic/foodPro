In 2D, you can imagine that the liquid at the furthest point from the walls of a pipe is moving the fastest. The layer of liquid in direct contact with the walls is assumed to have zero velocity (this is referred to as the ‚Äúno slip‚Äù condition). There is therefore a gradient of velocities, ranging from zero velocity to max velocity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe flow pattern described above will later be used to derive the equation and dimensions for viscosity.\n\n\nThe reason for this behaviour is viscosity, which ‚Äî according to this model ‚Äî can be imagined as friction generated between the liquid and the walls but also between the individual layers of liquid."

It should be noted that the equation strictly only works in systems with laminar flow (\\(Re < 2100\\)), so it is not appropriate to use it for determining flow-rate or viscosity in turbulence (\\(Re > 4000\\)) systems.\nIn general, to attain an equivalent flow-rate for a low-viscosity and a high-viscosity fluid, the higher viscosity fluid will require a greater pressure drop."

    "section": "Measuring Pressure in Food Processes",
    "text": "Measuring Pressure in Food Processes\nPressure is measured typically using a pressure gauge. The classical pressure gauge consists of a dial with pressure markings and a pointer. The pointer is connected to a mechanism that responds to changes in pressure. Digital gauges are increasingly used but not always.\nMost gauges give a reading for ‚Äúgauge pressure‚Äù. This means that if the pressure being measured is at atmospheric pressure the gauge will read zero. Absolute pressure is the true pressure, including the atmospheric pressure, and can be calculated as: \\(P_{abs} = P_{gauge} + P_{atm}\\) in obvious symbols. It should be noted that if measuring pressure drop then it does not matter whether you use absolute or gauge pressure, as long as you are consistent (don‚Äôt subtract gauge from absolute or vice-versa).\nTwo common designs are the Bourdon and Diaphragm gauge.\nA Bourdon gauge contains a flexible ‚ÄúBourdon tube‚Äù, usually in a C-shape that follows the circular shape of the dial. The tube is open to the fluid being measured and closed on one end. In a pipe, liquid enters the tube and partially expands the tube. The higher the pressure of the fluid the more expansion that takes place. The expansion (or de-expansion) affects a mechanism consisting of levers and gears that change the position of the pointer.\nIn comparison, a diaphragm gauge separates the internal mechanism of the gauge from the fluid being measured. A thin, flexible diaphragm gets deflected based on the pressure of the fluid. The extent to which the diaphragm gets deflected drives the position of the pointer.\nIn food processing facilities, it is common to encounter both kinds of gauge. Typically, diaphragm gauges are preferred in food-contact situations, in which sanitary design is critical. For example, if a viscous food material is permitted to fill a Bourdon tube contamination of the food may occur over time due to the build-up of residues inside the gauge. The use of a diaphragm gauge, which separates the internal environment of the gauge from the external environment of the fluid, prevents this happening.\nNot every fluid in a food processing facility may need a diaphragm gauge, however, which is important given that they tend to be more expensive. In the pumping of chilled water, hot water, steam or compressed air, a Bourdon gauge may be sufficient. For example, ingredients are often mixed in jacketed vessels that have gaps in their walls through which a cooling or heating fluid flows. To ensure reliable flow of these utilities pressure may need to be measured, but because the fluids never contact the food (they are separated by a wall) a Bourdon gauge can be used. It is also simply far more difficult to effectively remove something like milk from a Bourdon tube compared to clean water ‚Äî the milk is more viscous, can go sour and even become solid, making cleaning very difficult. Lastly, if liquids being processed are corrosive it might also be wise to choose a diaphragm gauge, as this will protect the gauge itself grom damage and ensure a longer life before it needs to be replaced.\nThe principles outlined above for the sanitary use and installation of pressure gauges also extends to a variety of other equipment, like sensors, meters and actuators."

In this section we have been talking about separations, in which components are separated from each other by exploiting some difference. Probably the most everyday example of a separation is making tea or coffee. Assuming we are not using ‚Äúinstant‚Äù products, how we make coffee is by exposing solid tea leaves or coffee beans to a solvent ‚Äî usually water. This kind of separation operation is known as leaching.\nIn leaching, a solid material is exposed to a solvent that dissolves soluble constituents present in the solid matrix. For example, polyphenols, acids and caffeine are found in coffee beans, and are dissolved in hot water during brewing. The actual process ‚Äî up the point of generating the extract ‚Äî involves more steps than brewing, however. Prior to brewing the coffee beans must be conditioned to make the separation process of as efficient and effective as possible."

    "text": "Roasting\nThe roasting process involves exposing green coffee beans to elevated temperatures between 90 and 230¬∞C. The intensity of the process depends on the desired quality characteristics of the final coffee. During roasting the beans develop colour and aroma due to the Maillard browning reaction that occurs between reducing sugars and proteins, as well as caramelisation. Two characteristic ‚Äúcracks‚Äù occur during roasting. The first crack (at 196¬∞C) signifies that the coffee is approaching a light-medium roast, and the second (at 224¬∞C) signifies that the coffee is approaching a dark roast. Controlling the roasting conditions dictates the sensory properties of the coffee.\nDuring roasting the coffee beans absorb heat energy (endothermic phase), initiating the chemical reactions that change their sensory properties. Moisture present inside the coffee beans gradually converts into vapour, increasing the vapour pressure inside the bean. Eventually, the vapour pressure becomes so high that it physically ruptures the structure of the bean releasing heat into the environment (exothermic phase). This phenomenon results in the two characteristic ‚Äúcracks‚Äù that signal key stages of the roasting process. After the second crack, further changes occur, including the release of oils onto the surface of the bean. These and many other changes have practical consequences for the beans, including:\n\nThe loss of moisture makes the beans lighter to transport\nThe physical modifications to the bean make them easier to grind/mill\nThe release of oil makes beans more susceptible to oxidiation\nAcids and antioxidants breakdown during more intense roasting\n\nDuring roasting a byproduct is generated known as ‚Äúsilverskin‚Äù, at about 4-5% of the bean weight. This is residual mucilage from the coffee fruit that is separated from the bean during roasting at high temperatures. Scientists are seeking applications for this byproduct, which is produced in large volumes every year."

    "title": "Coffee",
    "section": "Grinding",
    "text": "Grinding\nGrinding is a simple size-reduction step. Its purpose is to increase the surface area of the beans. Increasing the surface area results in more effective leaching during subsequent brewing.\nIn general, the greater the size reduction the more energy input required during grinding. There are generally two categories of grinder: blade-style and burr-style. The two styles are analogous to a paddle-style mixer and rotor-stator that are encountered in industrial mixing.\nThe advantage of the rotor-stator mixer is that it generally yields a more uniform particle size distribution. In this style of grinder the particles are collected having passed through a precise gap between the rotating element and the static element. This means that particles that are too large to pass through this gap will simply not be present in the material that is collected ‚Äî in effect, it acts like a filter of size-classifier. On the other hand, once a blade-grinding process is stopped it is possible that there could be some large particles present. Rotor-stator/burr-style mixers are therefore prized for the consistency of the grind they produce, which also impacts the ultimate consistency of coffee that is produced.\nJust like there are multiple degrees of roasting that can be attained there are also multiple degrees of grinding. In the case of a rotor-stator, this is determined by the gap between the rotor and stator. Typically, coffee is produced in fine, medium and coarse grinds, which are suitable for extraction processes involving different pressure ranges.\nWhile a consumer or barista wanting to make the perfect cup of coffee can grind their coffee beans as finely as they wish, industrial manufacturers (e.g., instant coffee makers) need to carefully balance the trade-off between the increased yield associated with fine grinds (higher surface area -> greater extraction) and their reduced extraction speed (tighter packing of small particle -> slower extraction)."

    "text": "Extraction/leaching\nInterestingly, the extraction process can be understood in similar terms to filtration, which we encountered previously.\nRemember that in filtration we referred to Darcy‚Äôs Law:\n\\[J = \\frac{TMP}{\\mu \\cdot R}\\]\nThis described how the flux of permeate (\\(J\\)) through a filter was proportional to the transmembrane pressure (\\(TMP\\)) across the filter, with resistance due to viscosity of the permeate (\\(\\mu\\)) and resistances (\\(R\\)) due to the characteristics of the membrane and membrane fouling. Another common representation of Darcy‚Äôs law is shown below:\n\\[Q = -k \\cdot \\frac{A \\cdot \\Delta P}{\\mu \\cdot L}\\]\nHere, \\(k\\) is the permeability constant of a packed bed (the minus sign reflects the fact that flow is from a region of high to low pressure: don‚Äôt worry about it), which could be sand (as Darcy originally studied) or coffee (which interest us here). The volumetric flow-rate of coffee \\(Q\\) through a bed of coffee depends on the cross-sectional area of flow \\(A\\). The resistance increases with the viscosity of the coffee \\(\\mu\\) and the length of the coffee bed \\(L\\).\nThink about the impact of the relationships described by this equation on coffee extraction. Think of whole coffee beans, which have gaps between them that are visible without close inspection; these gaps constitute pores during extraction. Now imagine the same beans having been ground to a small size ‚Äî the gaps/pores have also decreased in size, because smaller particles can fill these voids. We can assume then that the permeability of beans ‚Äî represented by \\(k\\) ‚Äî decreases as we grind coffee more finely. For this reason we may need to create different amounts of pressure (\\(\\Delta P\\)) depending on the type of coffee being made: espresso machines (which use pumps) are required for fine grinds, while water can flow under gravity (low pressure) through coarse grinds. Keep in mind, however, that finely ground coffee may also pack more densely than coarse coffee (note: it is difficult/impossible to compress whole coffee beans); for this reason, at equivalent weights, it may be possible to reduce the length of the coffee bed significantly for fine grinds (this may partially offset the reduced flow-rate). One further complication is that during extraction the composition of the coffee is changing, unlike in the previous filtration examples; this means that water will dissolve an increasing concentration of solids over the course of the extraction process, increasing viscosity and therefore reducing flow-rate.\nGenerally, the impact of coffee grinding on extraction can be said to be as follows:\n\nIncreasing the surface area of particles accelerates the leaching of soluble molecules into water\nReducing porosity of the coffee bed reduces flow-rate, increasing the effective leaching time\nAt low porosities high pressures are required to permit acceptable rates of extraction\n\nThe coffee process then, which ends with extraction, involves a careful interplay between roasting (reduces water, increases flavour/aroma, physically conditions particles), grinding (increases surface area, alters porosity) and extraction (leaches soluble constituents from roasted and ground coffee).\nCoffee control charts can be used to optimise the sensory characteristics of coffee. Depending on the ratio of coffee to water (grams per litre) and the strength of the coffee generated (measured by refractometer) it can be determined whether a balanced cup of coffee will be made. Generally, a bean:water ratio of 55-70 g/L is required. This should generate solids contents of 1.20-1.45%. If not, brewing time or grinding intensity may need to be adjusted to hit this range. An example of a classic coffee control chart can be found at this link along with a description of recent research aimed at revising the classic chart."

These separation operations usually exploit some difference between the components to be separated.\nConsider an example that we have encountered multiple times: sedimentation/flotation. If a set of particles have a difference in density compared to the solvent they are dispersed in then they will tend to separate from the solvent over time. An operation like centrifugation exploits this difference and accelerates the separation effect.\nConsider a case where there are two sets of particles with approximately the same density but a significant difference in size.

If sufficient water is removed in this manner then the solids (i.e., everything that is not water) will be concentrated.\nEvaporation can be considered a kind of separation process. In evaporation water is separated from solids. This operation has the purpose of converting a dilute liquid into a more concentrated liquid. The difference that is exploited is that the solids are not volatile while the water is volatile.\nEvaporation shares some apparent similarities with distillation and drying but as an operation it is different. Drying usually involves the phase transition of evaporation but typically results in a physical transformation in the material being dried (e.g., from a liquid to a powder).

    "text": "Distillation\nDistillation is one of the oldest separation techniques and is still widely used in a variety of industries. In the food industry, it is primarily associated with the production of distilled spirits. These products include vodka, gin and whisk(e)y.\nMost of these distillation processes start with a dilute ethanol solution. The aim of the distillation is increase the concentration of ethanol relative to water. Distillation exploits the fact that ethanol has a lower boiling point than water. Therefore, when a mixture of both is heated to its boiling point a sample of the resultant vapour will contain a greater quantity of ethanol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDuring your lab distillation is achieved using an iso-thermal process in which pressure is adjusted rather than temperature. When pressure is decreased the boiling point of the mixture is reduced. If pressure is decreased sufficiently then vapour will be generated that is more enriched in the more volatile component. This vapour can then be collected and re:distilled as described by reducing pressure again, and so on.\n\n\nThe vapour generated during heating of the mixture generates an ethanol-rich vapour that must then be collected. To collect the vapour the reverse phase transition is initiated by passing the vapour through a condenser. The condenser reduces the temperature of the vapour, resulting in its transformation back into a liquid (which is ethanol-rich). This condensed material can then be distilled a second time, with another cycle of heating-condensing resulting in an even greater concentration of ethanol.\nThis process can be continued until an azeotrope is created, in which the vapour generated from the mixture has the same composition as the starting liquid ‚Äî this renders further distillation pointless unless the process is modified using a vacuum or the inclusion of process aides.\nIndustrial processes for products like whiskey involve further complexities, particularly with respect to the equipment and terminology involved; however, the above description suffices for a basic understanding of distillation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDistillation is best understood using liquid-vapour composition curves, which are covered in the lecture that accompanied these notes.\nYou are advised to revisit that lecture and recreate those curves yourself to understand them.\nA bonus lectures on whisk(e)y production is also provided on the Youtube playlist for those of you who are interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nüìΩÔ∏è Direct link to slides for this lecture"

Nonetheless, it is counter-intuitive to many that it is merely the height (and not the volume) of water that determines the pressure. In practice, this means that very narrow columns of fluid can generate enormous pressures if the column is high enough (the hydrostatic paradox).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition Behind the Pressure Equation\n\n\n\nIntuitively we have some notion that \\(P\\) is associated with the weight \\(W\\) of liquid. So we might expect (wrongly) that\n\\[P = W\\]\nHowever, this cannot be correct because weight is a force not a pressure. So we might write:\n\\[F = W\\]\nThis is correct, but does not seem to tell us what we want to know, which is how to calculate \\(P\\). Now, to move forward we need to first consider that \\(\\frac{F}{A} = P\\), so we know that we need to ultimately divide our \\(F\\) value by an area (\\(A\\)) value. Obviously, there is no \\(A\\) value on the right-side of the equation, so we need to find one. To do this we consider that \\(W = m.a\\) and in the liquid column the acceleration is due to gravity:\n\\[F = m.g\\]\nNext, we recognise that \\(m = œÅV\\), so that:\n\\[F = œÅ.V.g\\]\nRemember, we would like to find an \\(A\\) value on the right side, so where is it? Well, consider that the dimensions of \\(V\\) are \\(L^3\\), which can be the product of an area with dimensions \\(L^2\\) and a length (\\(l\\)) with dimensions \\(L\\). So we can re-write the equation as:\n\\[F = œÅ.A.l.g\\]\nThe \\(A\\) value must refer to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (i.e., a circle), while the \\(l\\) value must refer to the height (\\(h\\)) of liquid. The volume of a cylinder is the product of the cross-sectional area by its height. Now, we can replace \\(l\\) by \\(h\\) and divide both sides by \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = P = œÅ.h.g\\]"

The greater the pressure the greater the height. This is the basis of traditional barometers used to measure pressure, where a more dense liquid (e.g., mercury) is used to ensure that the barometer does not need to be excessively large as an instrument (can you tell from the equation why this is so?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will encounter pressure head again when looking at Bernoulli‚Äôs equation, so you may need to return to these notes."

    "text": "Absolute and Gauge Pressure\nIn the tour of the processing facilities at UCC several pressure gauges were shown. These gauges were reading \\(0 \\ bar\\), yet atmospheric pressure is approximately \\(1 \\ bar\\). If the pressure was really zero then the processing facility would be in a vacuum.\nThe simple reason for this is that these pressure gauges do not give a readout of absolute pressure. Instead, they provide what is known as gauge pressure.\nGauge pressure is simply the pressure of the system minus the atmospheric pressure. Hence, if you want to convert a gauge pressure to absolute pressure you add the atmospheric pressure.\nFor example, the (gauge) pressure at the bottom of a tank of liquid is given by \\(P = \\rho g h\\) but to calculate the absolute pressure (\\(P_A\\)) we would use \\(P_A = P_S + \\rho g h\\), where \\(P_S\\) is the pressure acting on the surface of the liquid (atmospheric).\nIt is important to note that this distinction does not matter when it comes to pressure drop. To make sense of this statement, please review the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure drop\n\n\n\nConsider a pipe through which a liquid is flowing from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure. The first gauge reads \\(2.0 \\ bar\\) and the second gauge reads \\(1.5 \\ bar\\). The pressure drop is therefore \\(2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \\ bar\\).\nNow consider the same calculation, but this time we convert any gauge pressure into an absolute pressure by adding \\(1.0 \\ bar\\):\n\\[(2.0 + 1.0) - (1.5 + 1.0) = 0.5 \\ bar\\]\nAs you can see, when determining pressure drop (often what we are interested in) this distinction is unimportant."

So, while pressure can be created in a static liquid, we need to consider how this pressure can ultimately impact motion.\nA tank containing a liquid will exert pressure on the walls of the tank. The pressure will be greatest the deeper we dive below the surface. Place a pressure gauge just below the surface and one just above the bottom and there will be a difference in pressure.\nNow imagine there is a hole at the bottom of the tank. The pressure of the water inside the tank is high; however, the pressure outside the hole is the atmospheric pressure. As the pressure at the bottom of the tank is greater than the atmospheric pressure there will be a pressure drop from inside to outside.\nThis will also be true if we connect a pipe to the hole. The pressure at the start of the pipe is the pressure due to the depth of liquid (high), while the pressure at the end of the pipe is the pressure due to the atmosphere (low).\nAs you might expect, liquid will flow through the pipe, with the rate of flow determined by the pressure drop. While not a ‚Äúpump‚Äù in the classic sense, this is the simplest model of a pump we can think of. To get liquid to flow from one location to another we need a pressure drop. Here, the pressure drop is created due to the height of the liquid above an outlet.\nSeveral questions can be raised at this point:\n\nTo what extent does pressure drop determine flow-rate?\nHow does viscosity influence flow-rate?\nWhich pressure gauges are avaiable and how should they be selected?\n\nTo answer some of these questions we will again need to shift slightly between statics and dynamics before focusing on dynamics in a dedicated way."

    "section": "Types of filtration",
    "text": "Types of filtration\n\nDead-end\nA distinction is usually made between ‚Äúdead-end‚Äù and ‚Äúcross-flow‚Äù filtration. The former involves a type of filtration that is similar to the common use of filter paper in laboratories. A feed material flows perpendicularly towards the filter surface, with some material being retained (e.g., crystals) and others permeating (e.g., water). It is typically observed that this kind of filtration results in a rapid decline in permeation rate. While this is a minor inconvenience in a laboratory, it can be a major problem at industrial scale.\nThe reason for the decline in permeation rate is a loss of pressure and membrane fouling. Pressure (\\(P\\)) in such a system is given by \\(P = \\rho g h\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the liquid above the filter surface. Fouling is simply the accumulation of retained components on the membrane surface, which increases resistance against the flow of permeate. Common strategies to overcome these issues in a laboratory context might be:\n\nAdding more feed to the system (e.g., increasing pressure)\nDisplacing the fouling deposits with a glass rod (e.g., increase shear near the membrane surface)\nStopping the filtration and replacing the filter\n\n\n\nCross-flow\nMost membrane operations in industries like dairy involve cross-flow filtration. In cross-flow filtration the feed liquid flows across or parallel to the membrane surface. The feed then continuously removes fouling material from the membrane surface over time. Generally, this gives far superior performance to dead-end flow; however, it is not perfect and gradual fouling is still a problem.\nWhen attempting to develop strategies to maximise permeate flux it is useful to consider Darcy‚Äôs equation:\n\\[J = \\frac{TMP}{\\mu \\cdot R}\\]\n\\(J\\) signifies permeate flux (probably because \\(F\\) is already taken for ‚Äúforce‚Äù), \\(TMP\\) stands for Trans Membrane Pressure, \\(¬µ\\) for permeate viscosity and \\(R\\) for hydraulic resistance. To generate permeate a pressure drop must exist from the feed-side to the permeate-side. Pressure is supplied by a pump and through the closing of a valve on the retentate line.\nFor a filtration process to be productive and efficient it is typically preferable that permeate flux be rapid and sustainable. Intuitively, reading the equation above, it would seem obvious that a high \\(TMP\\) and a low viscosity would yield the best outcome in this regard. The \\(R\\) value can really be understood as the sum of two terms, one being the resistance due to the membrane and the other due to the fouling layer. In obvious symbols this can be written:\n\\[R = R_m + R_f\\]\nTo some extent, \\(R_m\\) is outside of our control, as it depends on the conditions under which the membrane was manufactured and the type of membrane process we are running. For example, in order of pore-size membrane processes fall into the following general categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicrofiltration > ultrafiltration > nanofiltration > reverse osmosis\n\n\n\nReverse osmosis (RO) involves the smallest pores, which only let water molecules through. The pores in nanofiltration (NF) membranes are larger and allow the passage of monovalent ions as well as water. Ultrafiltration (UF) lets sugars and divalent ions permeate, in addition to monovalents and water. Microfiltration (MF) membranes can be selected to retain bacteria and/or fat and/or some proteins, while allowing smaller molecules permeate.\nIt should be obvious that the smaller the pore-size, the greater the resistance the membrane resists the flow of permeate. This can be understood as one reason why the amount of pressure required for each category is in the order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRO > NF > UF > MF\n\n\n\nNF processes will simply require greater pressures than MF processes, which is a limitation associated with the construction of the membrane itself.\nWhat is under the control of the processor to a greater extent is resistance due to fouling and the viscosity of process fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMWCO\n\n\n\nWithin a specific membrane category, like UF, membranes can be purchased at different molecular-weight cut-off (MWCO) values. MWCO determines which molecules will be blocked from passing through the membrane. For example, in milk and whey the smallest protein is Œ±‚àílactalbumin, which has a molecular weight (MW) of 14 kDa. If the goal is to concentrate all protein the it is thus sufficient to select a MWCO that will ensure that this smallest protein does not permeate, as it follows logically that the larger proteins will not permeate if this condition is met. For this reason, UF of milk and whey is commonly performed using MWCOs of ~10 kDa."

    "section": "Optimising for permeate flux",
    "text": "Optimising for permeate flux\nDeclines in flux during filtration are common and typically caused by fouling of the membrane surface. The results in an increase in hydraulic resistance (\\(R\\) in Darcy‚Äôs equation). Fouling is a complex phenomenon which can be simply understood as the deposition of molecules at the surface of the membrane and, in some cases, inside the membrane pores themselves. An advantage of cross-flow filtration is that the feed material moves across the membrane surface during pumping, which contributes to the continuous removal of the fouling layer during filtration - this is not perfect, however.\n\nPermeate viscosity\nMost liquids decrease in viscosity as temperature increases. This is true unless a qualitative change occurs, such as when proteins denature and aggregate to form larger structures that impart greater viscosity. For these reasons a temperatures of approximately 40-60¬∞C have been common for filtration processes in the dairy industry (not too low, not too high), for example.\nDarcy‚Äôs Law includes a viscosity parameter that refers to permeate viscosity. The viscosity of permeate generated during filtration is typically low (similar to water). However, minor changes in permeate viscosity associated with temperature can have a significant effect on permeate flux.\n\n\nCross-flow, turbulence and retentate viscosity\nIn cross-flow filtration the feed flows parallel to the membrane surface, contributing to the removal of foulant. However, the effectiveness of this cross-flow mechanism is dependent on the turbulence generated by the feed flow. Turbulence is typically defined for pipes using the Re(ynold‚Äôs) number:\n\\[Re = \\frac{v \\cdot D \\cdot \\rho}{\\mu}\\]\nThe higher the \\(Re\\) the greater the turbulence. Two important factors in this equation are velocity (\\(v\\)) and viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)). Turbulence is directly proportion to the former and inversely proportional to the latter. In cross-flow filtration, maximising \\(v\\) is achieved by ensuring a sufficiently high feed-flow rate is attained.\nRetentate/feed viscosity can increase substantially during filtration due to an increased concentration of the feed. The increased viscosity can reduce cross-flow velocity and turbulence of the feed, which can contribute to fouling. Diafiltration ‚Äî the addition of water to the feed during filtration ‚Äî helps maintain a low viscosity. For the production of high-protein materials like whey protein isolate using filtration diafiltration is necessary.\nThe use of feed spacers, mesh-like structures that disrupt flow and generate turbulence are also common in most miodern cross-flow filtration systems.\n\n\nCritical flux\nFrom Darcy‚Äôs Law it can be assume that \\(J\\) increases linearly with \\(TMP\\). In reality, this is a simplification, and \\(J\\) plateaus beyond a certain ‚Äúcritical flux‚Äù. This creates a distinction between the linear (pressure-dependent) and plateau (pressure-independent) regions. The most severe fouling is associated the the pressure-independent region, which therefore should be avoided.\nIdeally, the highest TMP should be chosen in the pressure-dependant region of the J‚àíTMP curve; this means that if you adjusted the pressure in stepwise increments you would find a linear region that eventually transitions into a plateau ‚Äî the idea is to select the TMP before that plateau is reached, as the plateau is associated with high degrees of fouling. This requires a trade-off between short-term and long-term productivity, as the initial sacrifice in flux should pay off in longer run-times without requirements for process shutdown and cleaning.\n\n\nAnti-fouling technology\nMembrane fouling is a continued problem in the food industry. Scientists and engineers are investigating multiple approaches to minimise this phenomenon, such as:\n\nOptimising spacer mesh design to promote internal turbulence\nFabrication and modification of membrane polymers to repel depositing molecules\nUse of ultrasonication probes that physically remove fouled material\nApplication of ‚Äúdynamic membranes‚Äù that rotate or vibrate to disrupt foulant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUTP\n\n\n\nA very successful technology that was developed several years ago is Uniform-Transmembrane Pressure (UTP). The \\(TMP\\) value we calculate is actually an average of the pressure on the feed side (pressure on feed and retenate):\n\\[TMP = \\frac{P_{f} + P_{r}}{2}\\]\nThere is a pressure drop \\(\\Delta P\\) from the feed to the retentate, while the pressure on the opposite (permeate) side of the membrane is uniformly atmospheric.\nThis means that the \\(TMP\\) at individual points of the membrane surface is variable. Put simply: the TMP nearest the feed inlet is highest and that nearest the retentate outlet is lowest.\nConsider that the ‚Äúdriving force‚Äù for separation in a filtration process is TMP. The above situation means that a significant amount of the separation is happening in a small proportion of the membrane area (near the feed inlet).\nUTP is an effort to ensure that \\(TMP\\) is approximately equal throughout the length of the membrane. This can be achieved, for example, by recirculating the permeate on the permeate side of the membrane, such that after permeate is collected it is pumped on the permeate side from a position corresponding to the feed inlet (opposite side of membrane). This creates a high pressure region at the permeate inlet that reduces \\(TMP\\) at that point. The pressure at the permeate outlet is still atmospheric pressure, meaning that the TMP has only been reduced at the feed inlet, solving the problem of unequal TMP across the membrane length.\n\n\nExamples of two recent developments in this area are briefly described below.\n\nCharged membranes\nMost membrane processes to concentrate or fractionate proteins are based on pores being small enougn to physically repel larger molecules. By virtue of the molecules making physical contact with the membrane surface, however, these molecules can become associated with fouling layers.\nA recently-developed approach is to use larger pores that are activated with an electrostatic charge. For example, in a feed containing negatively charged proteins of 10 kDa in size a membrane can be selected with a MWCO of 100 kDa but that is modified to have a negative charge.\nThis system ensures that:\n\nThe proteins are repelled through electrostic forces\nFouling is mitigated by limiting protein-membrane contact\nMembrane resistance is decreased due to the high MWCO\nA high and sustainable permeate flux is created due to 1-3\n\nSuch charged membranes have been demonstrated to be successful at lab- and pilot-scale but have been adopted to a limited extent in the food industry to date.\n\n\nLow-temperature processing\nA somewhat counter-intuitive finding in recent years is that operating filtration plants at close to refrigeration temperatures can have benefits for ensuring more sustainable flux values.\nThe mechanism behind this is unclear at this point but what is apparent is that sacrificing the high initial fluxes associated with warm filtration can result in longer process runs, less down-time and reduced cleaning costs. This sacrifice in initial productivity to ensure long-term productivity is analogous to operation at sub-critical flux.\nIt is not all good news, however, as larger pumps may be required to handle the more viscous feed material and there may also be associated refrigeration costs. Nonetheless, several dairy companies have begun to transition to low-temperature processing."

Oil is less dense than water ‚Äî so oil droplets rise in water, driven by the density difference. What quantity would characterise the rate of the resultant change? Velocity. So we say that the rising velocity is proportional to the density difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nThe Reynold‚Äôs number (\\(Re\\)) is used to characterise the degree of turbulence in a flowing liquid.\nIt is written as follows:\n\\[Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\\]\nWhere \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the liquid, \\(v\\) is the flow velocity and \\(D\\) is the pipe diameter. The dimensions for viscosity are \\([M L^{-1} T^{-1}]\\) but you should know the rest.\nCan you show that \\(Re\\) has no dimensions?"

    "text": "Viscosity as Momentum Flux\nUp to this point we have a limited concept of what viscosity is. Dimensional analysis can help us develop an intuition.\nEarlier we derived the following equation based on the two-plate system:\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = \\mu \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThis is sometimes written with a minus sign to represent that the velocity is decreasing as we move from the top plate to the bottom plate:\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = -\\mu \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThis also yields an equation that is similar to a variety of other transfer equations used by engineers. For example, look at the resemblance between this equation and that describing the rate of heat transfer (\\(q\\)) through a body (the flow of heat from a warm to a cold region):\n\\[\\frac{q}{A} = -k \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThe fraction on the far left of the viscosity transfer equation represents shear stress and the fraction on the right is shear rate. Note that shear stress has the same formula as pressure; however, it is distinct from pressure. In physics you encounter the concept of scalars and vectors; the first has a magnitude but no direction while the former has a magnitude and a direction. We have conveniently been ignoring this distinction in order to avoid introducing unecessary complexity; for example, when discussing Stoke‚Äôs Law the velocity (a vector) either refers to a movement up (floating) or a movement down (sinking). On the other hand, when discussing pressure there is no associated direction; technically speaking, pressure is isotropic, meaning that pressure applied at a point is equal in all directions (the directions effectively cancel out). Shear stress is more like a vector than a scalar (to be precise it is a second-order tensor, but this is beyond our scope), in that it can be thought of as having an associated direction; for our purposes, the two directions can either be perpendicular to a surface (normal stress) or parallel to a surface (shear stress). The application of a shear stress to a liquid results in the liquid having a shear rate (it deforms in the direction of the shear stress).\nThe dimensions of shear stress are equivalent to pressure: \\([MLT^{-2}][L^{-2}]\\).\nThese dimensions are equivalent to the following: \\([MLT^{-1}][T^{-1}][L^{-2}]\\).\nFrom left to right, this reads ‚Äúmomentum per time per area‚Äù, also known as ‚Äúmomentum flux‚Äù.\nNote that momentum \\(p\\) is defined usually as \\(p = m \\cdot v\\) (mass times velocity).\nThe physical meaning of momentum flux in the context of viscosity can be explained as follows:\n\nThe top layer of liquid has the greatest velocity and therefore the greatest momentum. The lowest layer of the liquid has the lowest momentum. As the liquid is sheared from left to right momentum is transferred top-down. Layers with higher momentum lose momentum to layers with lower momentum. This results in a gradual loss of momentum between the top and bottom plate.\n\nTherefore there is shear being applied horizontally at the surface of the liquid and momentum transferring downwards."

The mathematics and physics knowledge required is not advanced.\n\nVolumetric Flow-rate\nFlow-rate for liquids is usually given the symbol \\(Q\\) and is defined as:\n\\[Q = \\frac{V}{t}\\]\nThe units are most commonly \\(L \\ h^{-1}\\) or \\(m^3 \\ h^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWriting \\(L \\ h^{-1}\\) is equivalent to \\(L/h\\).\nSimilarly, \\(m \\ s^{-2}\\) ‚Äî the units of acceleration ‚Äî can also be written \\(m/s^{2}\\).\nDo not let the exponents and negative numbers confuse you and rewrite them if it helps.\n\n\nA common method of measuring flow-rate in a lab is to periodically measure the volume collected over a certain period of time. For example, if 300 mL is collected from a pipe in 30 seconds we could convert this to a flow-rate by first converting mL ‚Üí L:\n\\[\\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3 \\ L\\]\nThis means that 0.3 L is collected per 30 s, but we need the volume in an hour, so we do the following:\n\\[0.3 \\times 2 \\times 60 = 36 \\ L \\ h^{-1}\\]\nThis quantity is known sometimes as the ‚Äúvolumetric flow-rate‚Äù. If units for mass (e.g., kg) are used instead then it ‚Äúmass flow rate‚Äù.\n\n\nVelocity of flow\nThe volumetric flow-rate (\\(Q\\)) has the units \\(m^3 \\ s^{-1}\\).\nWe know that a common way of expressing velocity is meters-per-second. From the units above we can expect that to calculate velocity of flow we simply divide \\(Q\\) by an area \\(A\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can we ‚Äúexpect‚Äù this? Because to convert \\(m^3\\) to \\(m\\) (or \\(m^1\\)) we need to divide by \\(m^2\\), when these values are divided the exponents subtract like so: \\(\\frac{m^3}{m^2} = m^{3-2} = m^1 = m\\).\n\n\n\n\\[v = \\frac{Q}{A}\\]\nThe area in this case is the cross-sectional area of flow. In food engineering calculations this is nearly always the area of a disc (because we are usually dealing with pipes).\nThe velocity is often required in equations where the flow-rate cannot be used (you need to understand that they are different). For example, the Reynold‚Äôs number used to define turbulence uses velocity not flow-rate.\nVelocity is a vector quantity, so to be more precise we could write \\(\\overrightarrow{v}\\). It also represents an average value, meaning that it represents the statistical average of a range of individual velocities. How this is normally represented is that a fluid moving through a pipe consists of stream-lines, each flowing in a specific direction. In laminar (non-turbulent) flow the maximum velocity is in the centre and the velocity at the edges is \\(0\\). This means that liquids flows in a ‚Äúcurved‚Äù fashion, with the fastest streamlines in the centre."

    "text": "Velocity, Turbulence and Residence Time\n\nProblem\nConsider a pipe through which a cold liquid flows. The pipe is surrounded by a shell through which a hot liquid flows. This is a basic ‚Äúshell-and-tube‚Äù heat exchanger.\nOver time heat transfers from the hot liquid to the cold liquid. This kind of equipment is often used to reduce levels of bacteria in a liquid. Depending on the bacteria present, specific time-temperature combinations are required. For example, a common pasteurisation treatment is 72¬∞C √ó 15s.\nExposing the liquid to this temperature for 15s will be expected to reduce bacteria to a safe level. That is: if a bacteria takes 15s to pass through a section of the pipe where the temperature is 72¬∞ then it will be inactivated. It is important that all of the product is heated at this temperature for 15s to ensure it is safe, but it is also desirable not to exceed this time (if possible) as it can cause quality loss.\nHere is the issue: in laminar conditions, the liquid is not all moving at a uniform velocity. Therefore, the bacteria present in the liquid are moving at different velocities and will therefore move through the heat exchanger in different times. This also means that there is no guarantee that a given bacteria will be exposed to the target temperature for 15s.\n\n\nTheory\nThe volumetric flow-rate is defined as \\(Q = \\frac{V}{t}\\). From this equation we can take the residence time to be:\n\\[t = \\frac{Q}{V}\\]\nThe target is \\(t (s) = 15\\).\nThe average velocity (\\(v_{AVE}\\)) is given by \\(v_{AVE} = \\frac{Q}{A}\\). The average residence time (\\(t_{AVE}\\)) can be calculated by dividing tube length (\\(L\\)) by average velocity:\n\\[t_{AVE} = \\frac{L \\ (m)}{v_{AVE} \\ (ms^{-1})}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough there is one value for average velocity in reality the liquid moves at a different velocity depending on its position in the tube.\nSimilarly, there is an average residence time but in reality there is a distribution of residence times.\n\n\nIn laminar conditions (\\(Re < 2100\\)) the maximum velocity (\\(v_{MAX}\\)) is approximately double the average velocity:\n\\[v_{MAX} = 2 \\cdot v_{AVE}\\]\nThe average residence time at \\(v_{AVE}\\) is 15s. It takes 15s for the average particle moving at this velocity to traverse the pipe. How long does it take a particle that is double the speed? The answer is: half the value (7.5s), which is the minimum time (\\(t_{MIN})\\):\n\\[t_{MIN} = \\frac{t_{AVE}}{2}\\]\nThis means that there is a population of bacteria that have half the necessary residence time.\n\n\nSolution\nOne solution is simply to double the treatment time. If the liquid is heated for 30s, then the fastest moving particles will receive the necessary treatment time of 15s.\nHowever, this is not ideal, as the average particle will be exposed to a high temperature for twice the time that is necessary, which can lead to quality issues (e.g., cooked flavours, discolouration). While the product will be safe, it may not be acceptable from a sensory perspective.\nThe preferred solution is to ensure that the flow is turbulent. In turbulent flow the distribution of velocities is less wide. The fastest moving particles are only 1.2 times as fast as the average:\n\\[v_{MAX} = 1.2 \\cdot v_{AVE}\\]\nThis means that their residence time is approximately 0.8 times the treatment time, compared to 0.5 times for laminar flow.\nSo, instead of an increased time of \\(2 \\times 15s\\) only \\(1.2 \\times 15s\\) is needed. In turbulent conditions, a heating time of 18s results in the fastest moving particles receiving the heat treatment for 15s, while minimising negative quality effects associated with prolonged heating."
