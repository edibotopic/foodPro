In 2D, you can imagine that the liquid at the furthest point from the walls of a pipe is moving the fastest. The layer of liquid in direct contact with the walls is assumed to have zero velocity (this is referred to as the ‚Äúno slip‚Äù condition). There is therefore a gradient of velocities, ranging from zero velocity to max velocity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe flow pattern described above will later be used to derive the equation and dimensions for viscosity.\n\n\nThe reason for this behaviour is viscosity, which ‚Äî according to this model ‚Äî can be imagined as friction generated between the liquid and the walls but also between the individual layers of liquid."

Notably, viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is in the denominator, offering resistance against flow. All of the other terms (except the empirical factor \\(128\\)) reflects the geometry of the pipe. Simply put: increasing the diameter of the pipe \\(D\\) has an enormous positive effect on flow-rate while increasing its length \\(L\\) has a negative effect.\nBy re-arranging the equation it is possible to use this equation to solve for viscosity, which gives us one of the most simple models of a viscometer (an instrument for measuring viscosity). It should be noted that the equation strictly only works in systems with laminar flow (\\(Re < 2100\\)), so it is not appropriate to use it for determining flow-rate or viscosity in turbulence (\\(Re > 4000\\)) systems.\nIn general, to attain an equivalent flow-rate for a low-viscosity and a high-viscosity fluid, the higher viscosity fluid will require a greater pressure drop."

    "section": "Measuring Pressure in Food Processes",
    "text": "Measuring Pressure in Food Processes\nPressure is measured typically using a pressure gauge. The classical pressure gauge consists of a dial with pressure markings and a pointer. The pointer is connected to a mechanism that responds to changes in pressure. Digital gauges are increasingly used but not always.\nMost gauges give a reading for ‚Äúgauge pressure‚Äù. This means that if the pressure being measured is at atmospheric pressure the gauge will read zero. Absolute pressure is the true pressure, including the atmospheric pressure, and can be calculated as: \\(P_{abs} = P_{gauge} + P_{atm}\\) in obvious symbols. It should be noted that if measuring pressure drop then it does not matter whether you use absolute or gauge pressure, as long as you are consistent (don‚Äôt subtract gauge from absolute or vice-versa).\nTwo common designs are the Bourdon and Diaphragm gauge.\nA Bourdon gauge contains a flexible ‚ÄúBourdon tube‚Äù, usually in a C-shape that follows the circular shape of the dial. The tube is open to the fluid being measured and closed on one end. In a pipe, liquid enters the tube and partially expands the tube. The higher the pressure of the fluid the more expansion that takes place. The expansion (or de-expansion) affects a mechanism consisting of levers and gears that change the position of the pointer.\nIn comparison, a diaphragm gauge separates the internal mechanism of the gauge from the fluid being measured. A thin, flexible diaphragm gets deflected based on the pressure of the fluid. The extent to which the diaphragm gets deflected drives the position of the pointer.\nIn food processing facilities, it is common to encounter both kinds of gauge. Typically, diaphragm gauges are preferred in food-contact situations, in which sanitary design is critical. For example, if a viscous food material is permitted to fill a Bourdon tube contamination of the food may occur over time due to the build-up of residues inside the gauge. The use of a diaphragm gauge, which separates the internal environment of the gauge from the external environment of the fluid, prevents this happening.\nNot every fluid in a food processing facility may need a diaphragm gauge, however, which is important given that they tend to be more expensive. In the pumping of chilled water, hot water, steam or compressed air, a Bourdon gauge may be sufficient. For example, ingredients are often mixed in jacketed vessels that have gaps in their walls through which a cooling or heating fluid flows. To ensure reliable flow of these utilities pressure may need to be measured, but because the fluids never contact the food (they are separated by a wall) a Bourdon gauge can be used. It is also simply far more difficult to effectively remove something like milk from a Bourdon tube compared to clean water ‚Äî the milk is more viscous, can go sour and even become solid, making cleaning very difficult. Lastly, if liquids being processed are corrosive it might also be wise to choose a diaphragm gauge, as this will protect the gauge itself grom damage and ensure a longer life before it needs to be replaced.\nThe principles outlined above for the sanitary use and installation of pressure gauges also extends to a variety of other equipment, like sensors, meters and actuators."

    "text": "Pressure in Static Fluids\nPressure (\\(P\\)) is defined as:\n\\[P = \\frac{F}{A}\\]\nThis gives \\(P\\) the dimensions \\([M LT^{-2} L^{-2}]\\) or ‚Äî more simply ‚Äî \\([M L^{-1} T^{-2}]\\).\nConsider a liquid in a container in which there is no submerged object. In such a system the pressure at a given point can be calculated as:\n\\[P = \\rho g h\\]\nThe \\(\\rho\\) corresponds to the density of the liquid and \\(h\\) the height from the surface. As usual, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions Check\n\n\n\nDoes the second equation above yield the dimensions you expect?\n\n\nThe equation should ring true intuitively if you have ever experienced the increase in pressure when diving deeper into water. Nonetheless, it is counter-intuitive to many that it is merely the height (and not the volume) of water that determines the pressure. In practice, this means that very narrow columns of fluid can generate enormous pressures if the column is high enough (the hydrostatic paradox).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition Behind the Pressure Equation\n\n\n\nIntuitively we have some notion that \\(P\\) is associated with the weight \\(W\\) of liquid. So we might expect (wrongly) that\n\\[P = W\\]\nHowever, this cannot be correct because weight is a force not a pressure. So we might write:\n\\[F = W\\]\nThis is correct, but does not seem to tell us what we want to know, which is how to calculate \\(P\\). Now, to move forward we need to first consider that \\(\\frac{F}{A} = P\\), so we know that we need to ultimately divide our \\(F\\) value by an area (\\(A\\)) value. Obviously, there is no \\(A\\) value on the right-side of the equation, so we need to find one. To do this we consider that \\(W = m.a\\) and in the liquid column the acceleration is due to gravity:\n\\[F = m.g\\]\nNext, we recognise that \\(m = œÅV\\), so that:\n\\[F = œÅ.V.g\\]\nRemember, we would like to find an \\(A\\) value on the right side, so where is it? Well, consider that the dimensions of \\(V\\) are \\(L^3\\), which can be the product of an area with dimensions \\(L^2\\) and a length (\\(l\\)) with dimensions \\(L\\). So we can re-write the equation as:\n\\[F = œÅ.A.l.g\\]\nThe \\(A\\) value must refer to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (i.e., a circle), while the \\(l\\) value must refer to the height (\\(h\\)) of liquid. The volume of a cylinder is the product of the cross-sectional area by its height. Now, we can replace \\(l\\) by \\(h\\) and divide both sides by \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = P = œÅ.h.g\\]"

If both sides of the equation are divided by the product of \\(\\rho\\) and \\(g\\) then we get the following:\n\\[h = \\frac{P}{\\rho g}\\]\nThis is known as the ‚Äúpressure head‚Äù and tells us the height of a column of liquid that can be supported by a given pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf atmospheric pressure is \\(101325 \\ kg \\ m^{-1} \\ s^{-2}\\), \\(g\\) is \\(9.81 \\ m \\ s^{-2}\\) and the density of water is \\(1000 \\ kg \\ m^{-3}\\), estimate the height of a column of water that can be supported at atmospheric pressure.\nAssume that\n\\[h = \\frac{P}{\\rho g}\\]\nPlugging in values:\n\\[h = \\frac{101325}{1000 \\cdot 9.81}\\]\n\\(h = 10.3 \\ m\\)\nThus, the tendency of a column of liquid of a specific height to be supported by liquid at a specific pressure allows height (or ‚Äúpressure head‚Äù) to be used as an index of pressure. The greater the pressure the greater the height. This is the basis of traditional barometers used to measure pressure, where a more dense liquid (e.g., mercury) is used to ensure that the barometer does not need to be excessively large as an instrument (can you tell from the equation why this is so?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will encounter pressure head again when looking at Bernoulli‚Äôs equation, so you may need to return to these notes."

    "text": "Absolute and Gauge Pressure\nIn the tour of the processing facilities at UCC several pressure gauges were shown. These gauges were reading \\(0 \\ bar\\), yet atmospheric pressure is approximately \\(1 \\ bar\\). If the pressure was really zero then the processing facility would be in a vacuum.\nThe simple reason for this is that these pressure gauges do not give a readout of absolute pressure. Instead, they provide what is known as gauge pressure.\nGauge pressure is simply the pressure of the system minus the atmospheric pressure. Hence, if you want to convert a gauge pressure to absolute pressure you add the atmospheric pressure.\nFor example, the (gauge) pressure at the bottom of a tank of liquid is given by \\(P = \\rho g h\\) but to calculate the absolute pressure (\\(P_A\\)) we would use \\(P_A = P_S + \\rho g h\\), where \\(P_S\\) is the pressure acting on the surface of the liquid (atmospheric).\nIt is important to note that this distinction does not matter when it comes to pressure drop. To make sense of this statement, please review the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure drop\n\n\n\nConsider a pipe through which a liquid is flowing from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure. The first gauge reads \\(2.0 \\ bar\\) and the second gauge reads \\(1.5 \\ bar\\). The pressure drop is therefore \\(2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \\ bar\\).\nNow consider the same calculation, but this time we convert any gauge pressure into an absolute pressure by adding \\(1.0 \\ bar\\):\n\\[(2.0 + 1.0) - (1.5 + 1.0) = 0.5 \\ bar\\]\nAs you can see, when determining pressure drop (often what we are interested in) this distinction is unimportant."

    "text": "From Static to Movement\nFluid statics concerns the state of fluids ‚Äúat rest‚Äù (not moving); however, as we saw in the example of Stoke‚Äôs law, we usually use these static systems is simplified models that help us understand more complex (moving) systems. So, while pressure can be created in a static liquid, we need to consider how this pressure can ultimately impact motion.\nA tank containing a liquid will exert pressure on the walls of the tank. The pressure will be greatest the deeper we dive below the surface. Place a pressure gauge just below the surface and one just above the bottom and there will be a difference in pressure.\nNow imagine there is a hole at the bottom of the tank. The pressure of the water inside the tank is high; however, the pressure outside the hole is the atmospheric pressure. As the pressure at the bottom of the tank is greater than the atmospheric pressure there will be a pressure drop from inside to outside.\nThis will also be true if we connect a pipe to the hole. The pressure at the start of the pipe is the pressure due to the depth of liquid (high), while the pressure at the end of the pipe is the pressure due to the atmosphere (low).\nAs you might expect, liquid will flow through the pipe, with the rate of flow determined by the pressure drop. While not a ‚Äúpump‚Äù in the classic sense, this is the simplest model of a pump we can think of. To get liquid to flow from one location to another we need a pressure drop. Here, the pressure drop is created due to the height of the liquid above an outlet.\nSeveral questions can be raised at this point:\n\nTo what extent does pressure drop determine flow-rate?\nHow does viscosity influence flow-rate?\nWhich pressure gauges are avaiable and how should they be selected?\n\nTo answer some of these questions we will again need to shift slightly between statics and dynamics before focusing on dynamics in a dedicated way."

Generally, when some kind of change is happening in a food process it occurs at a greater rate when the surface area is maximised.\nHere are two examples of this effect:\n\nThe transfer of heat is more rapid when the heat exchange surface has a large surface area\nThe evaporation of water from a liquid is more rapid when the liquid is in the form of droplets\n\nEarlier, it was shown that productive differences in temperature (heat exchange) and pressure (flow) can drive change during food processes.\nNow think about density. First, consider that alcohol is less dense than water. Imagine you are designing some process where the ratio of alcohol to water is increasing. How might this process be monitored, so that we can track the change and know when to stop the process?\nSimple: measure the density over time.\nNow consider a second example where density is important. Oil is less dense than water ‚Äî so oil droplets rise in water, driven by the density difference. What quantity would characterise the rate of the resultant change? Velocity. So we say that the rising velocity is proportional to the density difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nThe Reynold‚Äôs number (\\(Re\\)) is used to characterise the degree of turbulence in a flowing liquid.\nIt is written as follows:\n\\[Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\\]\nWhere \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the liquid, \\(v\\) is the flow velocity and \\(D\\) is the pipe diameter. The dimensions for viscosity are \\([M L^{-1} T^{-1}]\\) but you should know the rest.\nCan you show that \\(Re\\) has no dimensions?"

    "text": "Informally, viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a liquid to flow. It is a critical property in food that is important both in terms of processing behaviour and in consumer acceptance.\nViscosity is defined as the ratio of the deformation stress applied to a liquid and the extent of the resultant deformation. More formally, it is the ratio of shear stress to shear rate. A viscous liquid requires more shear to cause deformation (or flow).\nFor liquids to flow during food processing the viscosity of the liquid must be overcome.

    "text": "Ideal Liquids and Deviations from Ideality\nViscosity can be considered the slope of a plot of shear stress against shear rate:\n\\[\\sigma = \\mu \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}\\]\nEquipment like viscometers and rheometers can be used to generate data that can be used to plot such curves. Many of these devices consist of a static bottom plate and a moving/rotating top plate (similar to the model described above) ‚Äî this geometry is referred to as a ‚Äúparallel plate‚Äù. A liquid can be sheared between the two plates and its response (shear rate) measured, allowing a plot to be constructed.\nThe equations discussed above, however, apply to liquids for which a plot of shear rate against shear stress yields a linear curve (shear rate increases linearly with shear stress). Such liquids are referred to as ‚Äúideal‚Äù or ‚ÄúNewtonian‚Äù. Several liquids encountered in food processing are approximately Newtonian, including:\n\nWater\nBeer\nWine\nHoney\nOil\nSyrups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe name of Newton is invoked because Isaac Newton did significant early theoretical work on the viscosity of ideal physical systems.\n\n\nSeveral methods for measuring viscosity, including the falling ball and the u-tube assume that the liquid is Newtonian. However, there are also many liquids that are non-Newtonian. To understand what this means, imagine you are measuring the viscosity of two different liquids ‚Äî oil and yogurt. You do not have a viscometer so you are just going to use a spoon, stirring each liquid with different degrees of intensity. What you will find is that the viscosity of the oil stays the same regardless of how intensely you stir, while the viscosity of the yogurt tends to decrease the more intensely you stir. The viscosity of the oil is independent of the shear stress, while for yogurt the viscosity decreases with increasing shear stress. Therefore, the yogurt is non-Newtonian and ‚Äî more specifically ‚Äî shear-thinning. Another example of a shear-thinning liquid is ketchup, which often must be shaken (sheared) before being squeezed through an orifice. The opposite type of liquid is also encountered, and is known as shear-thickening, an example being solutions of corn starch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Newtonian Liquids\n\n\n\n\nShear-thinning: viscosity decreases with increasing shear. A plot of shear rate against shear rate will shown an initial linear region that then curves upwards at higher stresses.\nShear-thickening: viscosity increases with increasing shear. A plot of shear rate against shear rate will shown an initial linear region that then curves downwards at higher stresses.\n\nMeasuring these liquids using techniques like the faling ball is inappropriate. Variable-sheer devices like rheometers are instead required."

    "section": "Viscosity as Momentum Flux",
    "text": "Viscosity as Momentum Flux\nUp to this point we have a limited concept of what viscosity is. Dimensional analysis can help us develop an intuition.\nEarlier we derived the following equation based on the two-plate system:\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = \\mu \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThis is sometimes written with a minus sign to represent that the velocity is decreasing as we move from the top plate to the bottom plate:\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = -\\mu \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThis also yields an equation that is similar to a variety of other transfer equations used by engineers. For example, look at the resemblance between this equation and that describing the rate of heat transfer (\\(q\\)) through a body (the flow of heat from a warm to a cold region):\n\\[\\frac{q}{A} = -k \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThe fraction on the far left of the viscosity transfer equation represents shear stress and the fraction on the right is shear rate. Note that shear stress has the same formula as pressure; however, it is distinct from pressure. In physics you encounter the concept of scalars and vectors; the first has a magnitude but no direction while the former has a magnitude and a direction. We have conveniently been ignoring this distinction in order to avoid introducing unecessary complexity; for example, when discussing Stoke‚Äôs Law the velocity (a vector) either refers to a movement up (floating) or a movement down (sinking). On the other hand, when discussing pressure there is no associated direction; technically speaking, pressure is isotropic, meaning that pressure applied at a point is equal in all directions (the directions effectively cancel out). Shear stress is more like a vector than a scalar (to be precise it is a second-order tensor, but this is beyond our scope), in that it can be thought of as having an associated direction; for our purposes, the two directions can either be perpendicular to a surface (normal stress) or parallel to a surface (shear stress). The application of a shear stress to a liquid results in the liquid having a shear rate (it deforms in the direction of the shear stress).\nThe dimensions of shear stress are equivalent to pressure: \\([MLT^{-2}][L^{-2}]\\).\nThese dimensions are equivalent to the following: \\([MLT^{-1}][T^{-1}][L^{-2}]\\).\nFrom left to right, this reads ‚Äúmomentum per time per area‚Äù, also known as ‚Äúmomentum flux‚Äù.\nNote that momentum \\(p\\) is defined usually as \\(p = m \\cdot v\\) (mass times velocity).\nThe physical meaning of momentum flux in the context of viscosity can be explained as follows:\n\nThe top layer of liquid has the greatest velocity and therefore the greatest momentum. The lowest layer of the liquid has the lowest momentum. As the liquid is sheared from left to right momentum is transferred top-down. Layers with higher momentum lose momentum to layers with lower momentum. This results in a gradual loss of momentum between the top and bottom plate.\n\nTherefore there is shear being applied horizontally at the surface of the liquid and momentum transferring downwards."
