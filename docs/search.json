    "text": "Foods are complex in the sense that they consist of many parts related to each other in different ways. One ingredient might be present as a solute (dissolved in water) while another might be dispersed (suspended in water). When food scientists refer to ‚Äúfood structure‚Äù they often mean the totality of these parts and relationships. We do not need to go into detailed chemistry or physics to explore these structures.\nConsider the three basic phases of matter: gas (G), liquid (L) and solid (S). In a given food system each can be dispersed in the other. When we say that a gas is dispersed in a solid we mean that the solid is continuous while the gas is present as discrete regions separate from each other (e.g., bubbles). In abbreviated form we can represent this as G/S.\nNow consider this table:\nEach pair represents a structure, of particular interest are:\nThere are important functional benefits to these various possible structures. For example, the incorporation of air into a food can be effective at both reducing caloric density as well as material costs. It is easy to forget that the presence of both an oil and a water phase is necessary for the co-existence of oil- and water-soluble nutrients (as well as flavours).\nFormulating foods involves combining the right ingredients at the right levels to form the right structure. In most cases a formulated food will be mixed until the resultant mixture is ‚Äústable‚Äù, although this does not necessarily mean that everything is dissolved. The aim is to create a structure that does no stratify quickly into different layers with different compositions."

    "text": "Ingredient Characteristics\nWhile most food processes are continuous, many begin with a batch operation called mixing. During this operation one or more ingredients (often in powder form) are combined with a liquid phase. The purpose of the operation is to promote the dissolution and/or dispersion of the ingredients.\nHow mixing proceeds depends to a great extent on the nature of the ingredients. Consider the case of a formulated nutritional beverage, which might contain the following ingredients (at an absolute minimum!):\n\nSucrose: soluble in water\nWhey protein: soluble in water but slightly hydrophobic\nCalcium citrate: insoluble in water (at non-acidic pH)\nPotassium chloride: soluble in water\nVitamins (various): may be soluble in water or oil\nVegetable oil: immiscible in water\n\nSucrose is a dense crystalline structure that will sink quickly but ultimately dissolve. Whey protein powders contain pockets of air and the hydrophobicity of the proteins tends to result in them floating at the liquid surface. Calcium citrate will not dissolve in a milk-like product but will dissolve in a juice-like product, as its chemical solubility increases in acidic conditions. It is therefore possible that at the end of a mixing process ‚Äî depending on the product and ingredients ‚Äî there may still be materials that are not fully dissolved.\nRegardless of the exact nature of what is happening during mixing, the goal is typically to mix the ingredients as quickly and effectively as possible. A prudent scientist will have at least one analytic method to determine if the mixing has been effective; for example, if a product is supposed to have 10% protein but a sample of the mixture after a few minutes of ambient storage shows that it has 7% protein there may be a mixing problem that needs to be addressed."

    "section": "Mixer Design",
    "text": "Mixer Design\nThe design of a basic mixer is simple and consists of:\n\nAn open vessel that allows ingredients to be added and the volume to be contained\nA paddle attached to a shaft that can be rotated continuously by a motor\n\nJust like in the previous lecture on membrane separations, turbulence has an important role to play in promoting mixing. The equation for turbulence in a mixer is very similar to what you have seen before; however, the motion is provided by the rotation of the paddle rather than the flow of a liquid through a pipe, which is reflected in the equation:\n\\[Re = \\frac{D^{2} \\cdot N \\cdot \\rho}{\\mu}\\]\nInstead of \\(D\\) representing the diameter of a pipe it represents the diameter of the paddle. Instead of the velocity of liquid flow we have the number (\\(N\\)) of paddle rotations per second.\nAn effective mixing operation requires us to maximise the collisions that occur between particles and other particles, as well as particles and the equipment. To do this we must maximise \\(Re\\).\nOnce we have a specific paddle and a specific set of ingredients there is little that we can do to alter \\(D\\) (assume we are stuck with the paddle the company bought) or \\(\\rho\\) (density is an intrinsic property of a liquid and varies little).\nSo we can increase \\(N\\) by adjusting the speed of the motor and we can decrease \\(\\mu\\) by increasing temperature. In most cases, an increase in temperature will also tend to increase the chemical solubility of solutes in the system during mixing.\nTo control temperature the mixing vessel needs to be jacketed, which allows a heating medium to be circulated in the walls of the vessel, thereby warming the mixture inside (to 40-60¬∞C).\nBy increasing mixing speed, reducing mixture viscosity and enhancing chemical solubility the mixing operation proceeds at a faster rate, at least in theory.\n\nVortices and Baffles\nIf you have ever mixed anything in a laboratory you are familiar with the vortex. You might assume that a big vortex is evidence that things are mixing well. This is ‚Äî in fact ‚Äî typically false.\nThe presence of a vortex is (often) bad for at least three reasons:\n\nIt reduces the effective volume being utilised in the vessel\nIt is evidence of non-chaotic mixing (laminar)\nIt can promote air incorporation and foaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn some circumstances a vortex might be desirable. For example, in a high-solids system where the sinking of an ingredient needs to be promoted to allow it to be effectively mixed.\n\n\nA simple approach to solving this problem is to break the vortex using baffles.\nIf you create a vortex in a beaker and then submerge a pen directly into the vortex the vortex will disappear ‚Äî this is because turbulence is created when liquid in motion encounters a static obstacle (this was observed/sketched by Leonardo Da Vinci and has been known for a very long time).\nIt is inconvenient (and unsanitary) for an operator to have to insert an object into the vessel so baffles are typically built in to the mixer design; hence, it is common to see baffles radiating from the inner walls of industrial mixers. These baffles acts as ‚Äúvortex breakers‚Äù, increasing the probability of turbulent mixing and ensuring the capacity of the vessel is effectively used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling Up\n\n\n\nA common issue in product development is scale-up.\nLet‚Äôs say the product developers have made something interesting in a beaker.\nThe developers meet with the marketers and get excited about the concept, so they decide to plan a large production trial.\nEven though the exact same ingredients are used the production run turns out to be a failure. The idea might be abandoned at this point.\nIn such cases it is greatly important to ensure that the mixers at different scales are as similar as possible.\nThis notion of similarity is complex but can include things like:\n\nIf the mixing is turbulent at lab-scale it needs to be turbulent at the larger scale also\nThe ratio of the paddle diameter to the vessel diameter should be equivalent\nTemperatures and times should be equal\nMixing pattern (axial/radial) should be equivalent\n\nNew ideas can be saved from the rubbish heap by ensuring consistency across scales (it is not just a matter of using the same ingredients).\n\n\n\n\nPaddle Shape and Flow Pattern\nIf you mix some dye into a mixer you tend to observe two distinct patterns of mixing:\n\nRadial: side-to-side motion\nAxial: up-and-down motion\n\nSpecific mixer designs promote one over the other.\n\n\n\nWhen designing or selecting mixing vessels care should be taken to read the technical documentation. What type of mixer are you using? Why are you using this mixer? Is this mixer performing for your use-case? The supplier of this technology should be able to advise on these matters\n\n\nIn general, the more aligned the paddle is with the vertical axis the more radial the mixing pattern, while the more slanted/pitched the paddle the more axial the mixing pattern.\nAxial flow mixers tend to be preferred when there is a significant risk that particles will separate from the mixture (e.g., the sedimentation of calcium citrate) and form deposits towards the vessel base.\nRadial flow mixers often perform better in high viscosity products that require more shear; however, due to the hydrodynamics of their shape, they tend to require greater energy input to move through the liquid."

    "section": "Dissolution problems",
    "text": "Dissolution problems\nIt is useful to distinguish between different stages of rehydration. Two powders may have the same total rehydration time. If this time is too long it is tempting to optimise the rehydration of each powder in the same way; however, each might a different stage of rehydration that is causing the problem. To shorten the rehydration time effectively you then need to identify what the problematic stage is and use the appropriate strategy to shorten the duration of that stage, which will have the maximum return on investment (so to speak).\nThe rate-limiting stage is the stage that has the longest duration for a given solubilisation of a powder. For example, the rate-limiting stage for whey protein powders is wetting while for casein-based powders it is dispersion. Practically speaking, this means that wetting must be optimised in the first case and dispersion in the latter. A brief description of each stage follows (the stages are ordered roughly according to the sequence in which they occur during solubilisation; however, this is a massive simplification as in reality the stages will overlap):\n\nStages of Rehydration\nThere is an associated ‚Äúproperty‚Äù associated with each stage: wettability, sinkability, dispersibility and (in)solubility, each of which has a classical standard method of testing. Increasingly, however, there has been a shift towards measuring the rate of completion of these stages using dynamic methods.\n\nWetting: in the wetting stage the powder particles first make contact with water. A poorly-wetting powder will float on the surface of the water for an extended period, usually due to the high surface hydrophobicity of particles.\nSinking: when a particle finishes wetting it begins to sink. This can be understood as the air within the particles being displaced by water, which is more dense, causing the particles to sink. Of course, if a powder has a high particle density to begin with (i.e., due to a low level of air) then the powder is likely to have a high sinkability. Sinking can be promoted through vortex formation, which can be preferable in some applications.\nDispersion: dispersion involves the physical fragmentation of powder particles into smaller particles. Most powder particles are >50 microns and during dispersion this particle size will decrease to <1 microns. The progress of dispersion coincides with significant changes in the properties of the suspension, most notably a reduction in the levels of solids that sediment when the suspension is at rest.\nDissolution: dissolution can be understood as an end-state rather than a a dynamic stage itself. When a powder has finished dispersing molecules and ions in the powder will be released into the solution. After this occurs various chemical changes will commence, such as the establishment of chemical equilibria, the solvation of proteins and so on. Before these changes are complete the powder is still properly understood as being ‚Äúdissolved‚Äù.\n\n\n\nWetting- and dispersion-limiting powders\nThere is a broad range of food powders in existence. There are mineral powders that are only truly soluble in acid, and insoluble protein powders that must be rehydrated in alkali. In the plant protein space it is frequently necessary to use hydrolytic enzymes to achieve satisfactory rehydration performance. These are particular cases in which the solution is often well established and has a well-understood chemical basis; for example, many mineral-based powders are comprised primarily of calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, minerals with a poor solubility at neutral-alkaline pH. In these relatively simple cases what is essential is a familiarity with the material at hand and its underlying chemistry.\nAgain, however, food powders are often more complex. In the dairy powder space, it has long been understood that certain principles when applied will create a quickly-rehydrating powder, for example:\n\nAgglomerate the powder if possible\nMix the powders at an elevated temperature\nApply vigorous mixing conditions\n\nMore recently, milk powders have been developed that have created new problems, which has led in turn to the development of new solutions. The powders in question include high-protein varieties that are rich in either whey protein or casein. It has been shown that for high whey protein powders, like whey protein concentrate (WPC) and whey protein isolate (WPI), wetting is the rate-limiting stage. On the other hand, for high casein powders like milk protein concentrate (MPC) and milk protein isolate (MPI), dispersion is the rate-limiting stage. Thus, to accelerate the rehydration of each kind of powder a different strategy is required. In the case of WPI it has been found that approaches traditionally used for fatty powders, like whole milk powder, can be quite successful. This typically involves the addition of surfactants like lecithin to improve the wettability of the powder particles. For MPI, the focus is typically in increasing the energy put during the dispersion stage, such that the particles are more likely to fragment. This might involve rehydration at elevated temperature and/or the use of high-shear mixing."

    "section": "Other Topics",
    "text": "Other Topics\n\nContinuous Mixing\nConventionally, most industrial mixing operations are operated batch-wise. However, there are technological options for promoting the mixing of ingredients continuously in-line (in the pipe).\nThe first option is the static mixer, which is similar in principle to the feed spacers encountered in the membrane lectures. These are mesh-like structures that sit inside a region of piping, where their position is fixed, functioning to promote turbulence (and therefore inter-mixing). Static mixers are especially useful for mixing materials that dissolve relatively quickly; for example, a water-soluble dye in water.\nPowder inductors offer a method of continuously entraining and dissolving powder in a liquid. Often ‚Äî though not always ‚Äî they are configured to have a hopper attached from above to an opening in a pipe. A narrowing in the pipe area below the hopper outlet creates a venturi effect, creating a pressure drop that continuously pulls powder into the liquid while simultaneously accelerating the water/powder mixture in the direction of liquid flow.\n\n\nMonitoring Mixing\nThe measurement of mixing effectiveness depends on the nature of the materials being mixed. For example, \\(NaCl\\) will dissociate into \\(Na^+\\) and \\(Cl^-\\) during dissolution. The generation of these two ionic species will result in an increase in conductivity, meaning that the rise in conductivity and eventual plateau can be used to monitor the mixing of this salt. On the other hand, oil droplets are not soluble when dispersed in an aqueous solvent. While they do not become dissolved they typically must be reduced in size if they are to be sufficiently stable, meaning that particle size measurements can be used to track their dispersion. Some ingredients, like casein extracted from milk, form opaque suspensions after mixing in water, meaning that light-scattering can be used to track their mixing performance. A holistic approach may be required in formulated systems containing multiple ingredients with different mixing behaviour.\nThe above examples are compatible with PAT (Process Analytic Technology) approaches to processing, as probes for conductivity, turbidity and particle size can be procured to monitor mixing in real-time. However, the conventional method of measuring solubility is off-line and relatively simple. It involves preparing a solution/suspension under controlled conditions and taking a sample before and after mild centrifugation. If a sample is 100% soluble then the solids content of the material after centrifugation should match the starting material. If a supernatant is generated during centrifugation then the solubility can be determined as follows:\n\\[Solubility \\ (\\%) = \\frac{Solids \\ in \\ supernatant}{Solids \\ in \\ starting \\ material} \\times 100\\]\nThe mixing conditions can then be optimised to reduce this solubility value.\n\n\nDry Mixing\nDry-mixing is less well studied compared to wet-mixing and perhaps less common. However, dry-mixing is practiced in the food industry (as well as the pharmaceutical industry). The equipment used in dry-mixing and the underlying principles are quite different from wet-mixing, making it almost a separate field of study.\nThe primary issue associated with dry-mixing is segregation, where different ingredients tend to become concentrated in specific regions. The reasons for segregation are complex, but usually arise when two ingredients have different sizes, shapes or densities. In the preparation of a nutrient powder or pharmaceutical tablet segregation can lead to dramatically inconsistent compositions, which can be a major problem from an efficacy perspective."

The layer of liquid in direct contact with the walls is assumed to have zero velocity (this is referred to as the ‚Äúno slip‚Äù condition). There is therefore a gradient of velocities, ranging from zero velocity to max velocity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe flow pattern described above will later be used to derive the equation and dimensions for viscosity.\n\n\nThe reason for this behaviour is viscosity, which ‚Äî according to this model ‚Äî can be imagined as friction generated between the liquid and the walls but also between the individual layers of liquid."

Notably, viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is in the denominator, offering resistance against flow. All of the other terms (except the empirical factor \\(128\\)) reflects the geometry of the pipe. Simply put: increasing the diameter of the pipe \\(D\\) has an enormous positive effect on flow-rate while increasing its length \\(L\\) has a negative effect.\nBy re-arranging the equation it is possible to use this equation to solve for viscosity, which gives us one of the most simple models of a viscometer (an instrument for measuring viscosity). It should be noted that the equation strictly only works in systems with laminar flow (\\(Re < 2100\\)), so it is not appropriate to use it for determining flow-rate or viscosity in turbulence (\\(Re > 4000\\)) systems.\nIn general, to attain an equivalent flow-rate for a low-viscosity and a high-viscosity fluid, the higher viscosity fluid will require a greater pressure drop."

    "section": "Measuring Pressure in Food Processes",
    "text": "Measuring Pressure in Food Processes\nPressure is measured typically using a pressure gauge. The classical pressure gauge consists of a dial with pressure markings and a pointer. The pointer is connected to a mechanism that responds to changes in pressure. Digital gauges are increasingly used but not always.\nMost gauges give a reading for ‚Äúgauge pressure‚Äù. This means that if the pressure being measured is at atmospheric pressure the gauge will read zero. Absolute pressure is the true pressure, including the atmospheric pressure, and can be calculated as: \\(P_{abs} = P_{gauge} + P_{atm}\\) in obvious symbols. It should be noted that if measuring pressure drop then it does not matter whether you use absolute or gauge pressure, as long as you are consistent (don‚Äôt subtract gauge from absolute or vice-versa).\nTwo common designs are the Bourdon and Diaphragm gauge.\nA Bourdon gauge contains a flexible ‚ÄúBourdon tube‚Äù, usually in a C-shape that follows the circular shape of the dial. The tube is open to the fluid being measured and closed on one end. In a pipe, liquid enters the tube and partially expands the tube. The higher the pressure of the fluid the more expansion that takes place. The expansion (or de-expansion) affects a mechanism consisting of levers and gears that change the position of the pointer.\nIn comparison, a diaphragm gauge separates the internal mechanism of the gauge from the fluid being measured. A thin, flexible diaphragm gets deflected based on the pressure of the fluid. The extent to which the diaphragm gets deflected drives the position of the pointer.\nIn food processing facilities, it is common to encounter both kinds of gauge. Typically, diaphragm gauges are preferred in food-contact situations, in which sanitary design is critical. For example, if a viscous food material is permitted to fill a Bourdon tube contamination of the food may occur over time due to the build-up of residues inside the gauge. The use of a diaphragm gauge, which separates the internal environment of the gauge from the external environment of the fluid, prevents this happening.\nNot every fluid in a food processing facility may need a diaphragm gauge, however, which is important given that they tend to be more expensive. In the pumping of chilled water, hot water, steam or compressed air, a Bourdon gauge may be sufficient. For example, ingredients are often mixed in jacketed vessels that have gaps in their walls through which a cooling or heating fluid flows. To ensure reliable flow of these utilities pressure may need to be measured, but because the fluids never contact the food (they are separated by a wall) a Bourdon gauge can be used. It is also simply far more difficult to effectively remove something like milk from a Bourdon tube compared to clean water ‚Äî the milk is more viscous, can go sour and even become solid, making cleaning very difficult. Lastly, if liquids being processed are corrosive it might also be wise to choose a diaphragm gauge, as this will protect the gauge itself grom damage and ensure a longer life before it needs to be replaced.\nThe principles outlined above for the sanitary use and installation of pressure gauges also extends to a variety of other equipment, like sensors, meters and actuators."

    "text": "Roasting\nThe roasting process involves exposing green coffee beans to elevated temperatures between 90 and 230¬∞C. The intensity of the process depends on the desired quality characteristics of the final coffee. During roasting the beans develop colour and aroma due to the Maillard browning reaction that occurs between reducing sugars and proteins, as well as caramelisation. Two characteristic ‚Äúcracks‚Äù occur during roasting. The first crack (at 196¬∞C) signifies that the coffee is approaching a light-medium roast, and the second (at 224¬∞C) signifies that the coffee is approaching a dark roast. Controlling the roasting conditions dictates the sensory properties of the coffee.\nDuring roasting the coffee beans absorb heat energy (endothermic phase), initiating the chemical reactions that change their sensory properties. Moisture present inside the coffee beans gradually converts into vapour, increasing the vapour pressure inside the bean. Eventually, the vapour pressure becomes so high that it physically ruptures the structure of the bean releasing heat into the environment (exothermic phase). This phenomenon results in the two characteristic ‚Äúcracks‚Äù that signal key stages of the roasting process. After the second crack, further changes occur, including the release of oils onto the surface of the bean. These and many other changes have practical consequences for the beans, including:\n\nThe loss of moisture makes the beans lighter to transport\nThe physical modifications to the bean make them easier to grind/mill\nThe release of oil makes beans more susceptible to oxidiation\nAcids and antioxidants breakdown during more intense roasting\n\nDuring roasting a byproduct is generated known as ‚Äúsilverskin‚Äù, at about 4-5% of the bean weight. This is residual mucilage from the coffee fruit that is separated from the bean during roasting at high temperatures. Scientists are seeking applications for this byproduct, which is produced in large volumes every year."

    "text": "Grinding\nGrinding is a simple size-reduction step. Its purpose is to increase the surface area of the beans. Increasing the surface area results in more effective leaching during subsequent brewing.\nIn general, the greater the size reduction the more energy input required during grinding. There are generally two categories of grinder: blade-style and burr-style. The two styles are analogous to a paddle-style mixer and rotor-stator that are encountered in industrial mixing.\nThe advantage of the rotor-stator mixer is that it generally yields a more uniform particle size distribution. In this style of grinder the particles are collected having passed through a precise gap between the rotating element and the static element. This means that particles that are too large to pass through this gap will simply not be present in the material that is collected ‚Äî in effect, it acts like a filter of size-classifier. On the other hand, once a blade-grinding process is stopped it is possible that there could be some large particles present. Rotor-stator/burr-style mixers are therefore prized for the consistency of the grind they produce, which also impacts the ultimate consistency of coffee that is produced.\nJust like there are multiple degrees of roasting that can be attained there are also multiple degrees of grinding. In the case of a rotor-stator, this is determined by the gap between the rotor and stator. Typically, coffee is produced in fine, medium and coarse grinds, which are suitable for extraction processes involving different pressure ranges.\nWhile a consumer or barista wanting to make the perfect cup of coffee can grind their coffee beans as finely as they wish, industrial manufacturers (e.g., instant coffee makers) need to carefully balance the trade-off between the increased yield associated with fine grinds (higher surface area -> greater extraction) and their reduced extraction speed (tighter packing of small particle -> slower extraction)."

    "text": "Extraction/leaching\nInterestingly, the extraction process can be understood in similar terms to filtration, which we encountered previously.\nRemember that in filtration we referred to Darcy‚Äôs Law:\n\\[J = \\frac{TMP}{\\mu \\cdot R}\\]\nThis described how the flux of permeate (\\(J\\)) through a filter was proportional to the transmembrane pressure (\\(TMP\\)) across the filter, with resistance due to viscosity of the permeate (\\(\\mu\\)) and resistances (\\(R\\)) due to the characteristics of the membrane and membrane fouling. Another common representation of Darcy‚Äôs law is shown below:\n\\[Q = -k \\cdot \\frac{A \\cdot \\Delta P}{\\mu \\cdot L}\\]\nHere, \\(k\\) is the permeability constant of a packed bed (the minus sign reflects the fact that flow is from a region of high to low pressure: don‚Äôt worry about it), which could be sand (as Darcy originally studied) or coffee (which interest us here). The volumetric flow-rate of coffee \\(Q\\) through a bed of coffee depends on the cross-sectional area of flow \\(A\\). The resistance increases with the viscosity of the coffee \\(\\mu\\) and the length of the coffee bed \\(L\\).\nThink about the impact of the relationships described by this equation on coffee extraction. Think of whole coffee beans, which have gaps between them that are visible without close inspection; these gaps constitute pores during extraction. Now imagine the same beans having been ground to a small size ‚Äî the gaps/pores have also decreased in size, because smaller particles can fill these voids. We can assume then that the permeability of beans ‚Äî represented by \\(k\\) ‚Äî decreases as we grind coffee more finely. For this reason we may need to create different amounts of pressure (\\(\\Delta P\\)) depending on the type of coffee being made: espresso machines (which use pumps) are required for fine grinds, while water can flow under gravity (low pressure) through coarse grinds. Keep in mind, however, that finely ground coffee may also pack more densely than coarse coffee (note: it is difficult/impossible to compress whole coffee beans); for this reason, at equivalent weights, it may be possible to reduce the length of the coffee bed significantly for fine grinds (this may partially offset the reduced flow-rate). One further complication is that during extraction the composition of the coffee is changing, unlike in the previous filtration examples; this means that water will dissolve an increasing concentration of solids over the course of the extraction process, increasing viscosity and therefore reducing flow-rate.\nGenerally, the impact of coffee grinding on extraction can be said to be as follows:\n\nIncreasing the surface area of particles accelerates the leaching of soluble molecules into water\nReducing porosity of the coffee bed reduces flow-rate, increasing the effective leaching time\nAt low porosities high pressures are required to permit acceptable rates of extraction\n\nThe coffee process then, which ends with extraction, involves a careful interplay between roasting (reduces water, increases flavour/aroma, physically conditions particles), grinding (increases surface area, alters porosity) and extraction (leaches soluble constituents from roasted and ground coffee).\nCoffee control charts can be used to optimise the sensory characteristics of coffee. Depending on the ratio of coffee to water (grams per litre) and the strength of the coffee generated (measured by refractometer) it can be determined whether a balanced cup of coffee will be made. Generally, a bean:water ratio of 55-70 g/L is required. This should generate solids contents of 1.20-1.45%. If not, brewing time or grinding intensity may need to be adjusted to hit this range. An example of a classic coffee control chart can be found at this link along with a description of recent research aimed at revising the classic chart."

In the food industry, it is primarily associated with the production of distilled spirits. These products include vodka, gin and whisk(e)y.\nMost of these distillation processes start with a dilute ethanol solution. The aim of the distillation is increase the concentration of ethanol relative to water. Distillation exploits the fact that ethanol has a lower boiling point than water. Therefore, when a mixture of both is heated to its boiling point a sample of the resultant vapour will contain a greater quantity of ethanol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDuring your lab distillation is achieved using an iso-thermal process in which pressure is adjusted rather than temperature. When pressure is decreased the boiling point of the mixture is reduced. If pressure is decreased sufficiently then vapour will be generated that is more enriched in the more volatile component. This vapour can then be collected and re:distilled as described by reducing pressure again, and so on.\n\n\nThe vapour generated during heating of the mixture generates an ethanol-rich vapour that must then be collected. To collect the vapour the reverse phase transition is initiated by passing the vapour through a condenser. The condenser reduces the temperature of the vapour, resulting in its transformation back into a liquid (which is ethanol-rich). This condensed material can then be distilled a second time, with another cycle of heating-condensing resulting in an even greater concentration of ethanol.\nThis process can be continued until an azeotrope is created, in which the vapour generated from the mixture has the same composition as the starting liquid ‚Äî this renders further distillation pointless unless the process is modified using a vacuum or the inclusion of process aides.\nIndustrial processes for products like whiskey involve further complexities, particularly with respect to the equipment and terminology involved; however, the above description suffices for a basic understanding of distillation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDistillation is best understood using liquid-vapour composition curves, which are covered in the lecture that accompanied these notes.\nYou are advised to revisit that lecture and recreate those curves yourself to understand them.\nA bonus lectures on whisk(e)y production is also provided on the Youtube playlist for those of you who are interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nüìΩÔ∏è Direct link to slides for this lecture"

In such a system the pressure at a given point can be calculated as:\n\\[P = \\rho g h\\]\nThe \\(\\rho\\) corresponds to the density of the liquid and \\(h\\) the height from the surface.

Nonetheless, it is counter-intuitive to many that it is merely the height (and not the volume) of water that determines the pressure. In practice, this means that very narrow columns of fluid can generate enormous pressures if the column is high enough (the hydrostatic paradox).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition Behind the Pressure Equation\n\n\n\nIntuitively we have some notion that \\(P\\) is associated with the weight \\(W\\) of liquid. So we might expect (wrongly) that\n\\[P = W\\]\nHowever, this cannot be correct because weight is a force not a pressure. So we might write:\n\\[F = W\\]\nThis is correct, but does not seem to tell us what we want to know, which is how to calculate \\(P\\). Now, to move forward we need to first consider that \\(\\frac{F}{A} = P\\), so we know that we need to ultimately divide our \\(F\\) value by an area (\\(A\\)) value. Obviously, there is no \\(A\\) value on the right-side of the equation, so we need to find one. To do this we consider that \\(W = m.a\\) and in the liquid column the acceleration is due to gravity:\n\\[F = m.g\\]\nNext, we recognise that \\(m = œÅV\\), so that:\n\\[F = œÅ.V.g\\]\nRemember, we would like to find an \\(A\\) value on the right side, so where is it? Well, consider that the dimensions of \\(V\\) are \\(L^3\\), which can be the product of an area with dimensions \\(L^2\\) and a length (\\(l\\)) with dimensions \\(L\\). So we can re-write the equation as:\n\\[F = œÅ.A.l.g\\]\nThe \\(A\\) value must refer to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (i.e., a circle), while the \\(l\\) value must refer to the height (\\(h\\)) of liquid. The volume of a cylinder is the product of the cross-sectional area by its height. Now, we can replace \\(l\\) by \\(h\\) and divide both sides by \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = P = œÅ.h.g\\]"

Place a pressure gauge just below the surface and one just above the bottom and there will be a difference in pressure.\nNow imagine there is a hole at the bottom of the tank. The pressure of the water inside the tank is high; however, the pressure outside the hole is the atmospheric pressure. As the pressure at the bottom of the tank is greater than the atmospheric pressure there will be a pressure drop from inside to outside.\nThis will also be true if we connect a pipe to the hole. The pressure at the start of the pipe is the pressure due to the depth of liquid (high), while the pressure at the end of the pipe is the pressure due to the atmosphere (low).\nAs you might expect, liquid will flow through the pipe, with the rate of flow determined by the pressure drop. While not a ‚Äúpump‚Äù in the classic sense, this is the simplest model of a pump we can think of. To get liquid to flow from one location to another we need a pressure drop.

    "text": "Types of filtration\n\nDead-end\nA distinction is usually made between ‚Äúdead-end‚Äù and ‚Äúcross-flow‚Äù filtration. The former involves a type of filtration that is similar to the common use of filter paper in laboratories. A feed material flows perpendicularly towards the filter surface, with some material being retained (e.g., crystals) and others permeating (e.g., water). It is typically observed that this kind of filtration results in a rapid decline in permeation rate. While this is a minor inconvenience in a laboratory, it can be a major problem at industrial scale.\nThe reason for the decline in permeation rate is a loss of pressure and membrane fouling. Pressure (\\(P\\)) in such a system is given by \\(P = \\rho g h\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the liquid above the filter surface. Fouling is simply the accumulation of retained components on the membrane surface, which increases resistance against the flow of permeate. Common strategies to overcome these issues in a laboratory context might be:\n\nAdding more feed to the system (e.g., increasing pressure)\nDisplacing the fouling deposits with a glass rod (e.g., increase shear near the membrane surface)\nStopping the filtration and replacing the filter\n\n\n\nCross-flow\nMost membrane operations in industries like dairy involve cross-flow filtration. In cross-flow filtration the feed liquid flows across or parallel to the membrane surface. The feed then continuously removes fouling material from the membrane surface over time. Generally, this gives far superior performance to dead-end flow; however, it is not perfect and gradual fouling is still a problem.\nWhen attempting to develop strategies to maximise permeate flux it is useful to consider Darcy‚Äôs equation:\n\\[J = \\frac{TMP}{\\mu \\cdot R}\\]\n\\(J\\) signifies permeate flux (probably because \\(F\\) is already taken for ‚Äúforce‚Äù), \\(TMP\\) stands for Trans Membrane Pressure, \\(¬µ\\) for permeate viscosity and \\(R\\) for hydraulic resistance. To generate permeate a pressure drop must exist from the feed-side to the permeate-side. Pressure is supplied by a pump and through the closing of a valve on the retentate line.\nFor a filtration process to be productive and efficient it is typically preferable that permeate flux be rapid and sustainable. Intuitively, reading the equation above, it would seem obvious that a high \\(TMP\\) and a low viscosity would yield the best outcome in this regard. The \\(R\\) value can really be understood as the sum of two terms, one being the resistance due to the membrane and the other due to the fouling layer. In obvious symbols this can be written:\n\\[R = R_m + R_f\\]\nTo some extent, \\(R_m\\) is outside of our control, as it depends on the conditions under which the membrane was manufactured and the type of membrane process we are running. For example, in order of pore-size membrane processes fall into the following general categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicrofiltration > ultrafiltration > nanofiltration > reverse osmosis\n\n\n\nReverse osmosis (RO) involves the smallest pores, which only let water molecules through. The pores in nanofiltration (NF) membranes are larger and allow the passage of monovalent ions as well as water. Ultrafiltration (UF) lets sugars and divalent ions permeate, in addition to monovalents and water. Microfiltration (MF) membranes can be selected to retain bacteria and/or fat and/or some proteins, while allowing smaller molecules permeate.\nIt should be obvious that the smaller the pore-size, the greater the resistance the membrane resists the flow of permeate. This can be understood as one reason why the amount of pressure required for each category is in the order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRO > NF > UF > MF\n\n\n\nNF processes will simply require greater pressures than MF processes, which is a limitation associated with the construction of the membrane itself.\nWhat is under the control of the processor to a greater extent is resistance due to fouling and the viscosity of process fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMWCO\n\n\n\nWithin a specific membrane category, like UF, membranes can be purchased at different molecular-weight cut-off (MWCO) values. MWCO determines which molecules will be blocked from passing through the membrane. For example, in milk and whey the smallest protein is Œ±‚àílactalbumin, which has a molecular weight (MW) of 14 kDa. If the goal is to concentrate all protein the it is thus sufficient to select a MWCO that will ensure that this smallest protein does not permeate, as it follows logically that the larger proteins will not permeate if this condition is met. For this reason, UF of milk and whey is commonly performed using MWCOs of ~10 kDa."

    "text": "Optimising for permeate flux\nDeclines in flux during filtration are common and typically caused by fouling of the membrane surface. The results in an increase in hydraulic resistance (\\(R\\) in Darcy‚Äôs equation). Fouling is a complex phenomenon which can be simply understood as the deposition of molecules at the surface of the membrane and, in some cases, inside the membrane pores themselves. An advantage of cross-flow filtration is that the feed material moves across the membrane surface during pumping, which contributes to the continuous removal of the fouling layer during filtration - this is not perfect, however.\n\nPermeate viscosity\nMost liquids decrease in viscosity as temperature increases. This is true unless a qualitative change occurs, such as when proteins denature and aggregate to form larger structures that impart greater viscosity. For these reasons a temperatures of approximately 40-60¬∞C have been common for filtration processes in the dairy industry (not too low, not too high), for example.\nDarcy‚Äôs Law includes a viscosity parameter that refers to permeate viscosity. The viscosity of permeate generated during filtration is typically low (similar to water). However, minor changes in permeate viscosity associated with temperature can have a significant effect on permeate flux.\n\n\nCross-flow, turbulence and retentate viscosity\nIn cross-flow filtration the feed flows parallel to the membrane surface, contributing to the removal of foulant. However, the effectiveness of this cross-flow mechanism is dependent on the turbulence generated by the feed flow. Turbulence is typically defined for pipes using the Re(ynold‚Äôs) number:\n\\[Re = \\frac{v \\cdot D \\cdot \\rho}{\\mu}\\]\nThe higher the \\(Re\\) the greater the turbulence. Two important factors in this equation are velocity (\\(v\\)) and viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)). Turbulence is directly proportion to the former and inversely proportional to the latter. In cross-flow filtration, maximising \\(v\\) is achieved by ensuring a sufficiently high feed-flow rate is attained.\nRetentate/feed viscosity can increase substantially during filtration due to an increased concentration of the feed. The increased viscosity can reduce cross-flow velocity and turbulence of the feed, which can contribute to fouling. Diafiltration ‚Äî the addition of water to the feed during filtration ‚Äî helps maintain a low viscosity. For the production of high-protein materials like whey protein isolate using filtration diafiltration is necessary.\nThe use of feed spacers, mesh-like structures that disrupt flow and generate turbulence are also common in most miodern cross-flow filtration systems.\n\n\nCritical flux\nFrom Darcy‚Äôs Law it can be assume that \\(J\\) increases linearly with \\(TMP\\). In reality, this is a simplification, and \\(J\\) plateaus beyond a certain ‚Äúcritical flux‚Äù. This creates a distinction between the linear (pressure-dependent) and plateau (pressure-independent) regions. The most severe fouling is associated the the pressure-independent region, which therefore should be avoided.\nIdeally, the highest TMP should be chosen in the pressure-dependant region of the J‚àíTMP curve; this means that if you adjusted the pressure in stepwise increments you would find a linear region that eventually transitions into a plateau ‚Äî the idea is to select the TMP before that plateau is reached, as the plateau is associated with high degrees of fouling. This requires a trade-off between short-term and long-term productivity, as the initial sacrifice in flux should pay off in longer run-times without requirements for process shutdown and cleaning.\n\n\nAnti-fouling technology\nMembrane fouling is a continued problem in the food industry. Scientists and engineers are investigating multiple approaches to minimise this phenomenon, such as:\n\nOptimising spacer mesh design to promote internal turbulence\nFabrication and modification of membrane polymers to repel depositing molecules\nUse of ultrasonication probes that physically remove fouled material\nApplication of ‚Äúdynamic membranes‚Äù that rotate or vibrate to disrupt foulant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUTP\n\n\n\nA very successful technology that was developed several years ago is Uniform-Transmembrane Pressure (UTP). The \\(TMP\\) value we calculate is actually an average of the pressure on the feed side (pressure on feed and retenate):\n\\[TMP = \\frac{P_{f} + P_{r}}{2}\\]\nThere is a pressure drop \\(\\Delta P\\) from the feed to the retentate, while the pressure on the opposite (permeate) side of the membrane is uniformly atmospheric.\nThis means that the \\(TMP\\) at individual points of the membrane surface is variable. Put simply: the TMP nearest the feed inlet is highest and that nearest the retentate outlet is lowest.\nConsider that the ‚Äúdriving force‚Äù for separation in a filtration process is TMP. The above situation means that a significant amount of the separation is happening in a small proportion of the membrane area (near the feed inlet).\nUTP is an effort to ensure that \\(TMP\\) is approximately equal throughout the length of the membrane. This can be achieved, for example, by recirculating the permeate on the permeate side of the membrane, such that after permeate is collected it is pumped on the permeate side from a position corresponding to the feed inlet (opposite side of membrane). This creates a high pressure region at the permeate inlet that reduces \\(TMP\\) at that point. The pressure at the permeate outlet is still atmospheric pressure, meaning that the TMP has only been reduced at the feed inlet, solving the problem of unequal TMP across the membrane length.\n\n\nExamples of two recent developments in this area are briefly described below.\n\nCharged membranes\nMost membrane processes to concentrate or fractionate proteins are based on pores being small enougn to physically repel larger molecules. By virtue of the molecules making physical contact with the membrane surface, however, these molecules can become associated with fouling layers.\nA recently-developed approach is to use larger pores that are activated with an electrostatic charge. For example, in a feed containing negatively charged proteins of 10 kDa in size a membrane can be selected with a MWCO of 100 kDa but that is modified to have a negative charge.\nThis system ensures that:\n\nThe proteins are repelled through electrostic forces\nFouling is mitigated by limiting protein-membrane contact\nMembrane resistance is decreased due to the high MWCO\nA high and sustainable permeate flux is created due to 1-3\n\nSuch charged membranes have been demonstrated to be successful at lab- and pilot-scale but have been adopted to a limited extent in the food industry to date.\n\n\nLow-temperature processing\nA somewhat counter-intuitive finding in recent years is that operating filtration plants at close to refrigeration temperatures can have benefits for ensuring more sustainable flux values.\nThe mechanism behind this is unclear at this point but what is apparent is that sacrificing the high initial fluxes associated with warm filtration can result in longer process runs, less down-time and reduced cleaning costs. This sacrifice in initial productivity to ensure long-term productivity is analogous to operation at sub-critical flux.\nIt is not all good news, however, as larger pumps may be required to handle the more viscous feed material and there may also be associated refrigeration costs. Nonetheless, several dairy companies have begun to transition to low-temperature processing."

Even at room temperature, some water molecules gain sufficient energy to become vapour but they are very few in number.

You can imagine the vapour pressure (\\(T_V\\)) as being opposed by the atmospheric pressure ‚Äî as the vapour pressure increases from a small value (at 20 ¬∞C) to a big value (at 100 ¬∞C), evaporation is able to proceed more rapidly as the vapour mor easily overcomes the atmospheric pressure.

Each stage consists of an enclosed chamber containing a series of tall, vertical tubes. The liquid to be concentrated falls down the inner walls of these tubes as a film. In the first stage steam is pumped into the shell that surrounds the tubes, heating the film through the walls of the tubes. A vacuum pump is used to reduce pressure in each effect (a partial vacuum is created, removing air molecules that would otherwise oppose vapour pressure), meaning that the boiling temperature of the liquid is reduced. In the first stage, the concentrate is separated from the vapour, both are then passed into the second stage, which operates at a lower pressure than the first ‚Äî at this lower pressure the vapour can act as the heating medium, promoting the evaporation of more water from the concentrate. This process can be repeated across up to seven stages, with pressure decreasing at each successive stage as the liquid becomes more concentrated and the vapour is continuously recycled to use as the heating medium (instead of steam). Vapour is collected at the end of the operation and cooled into liquid water by a condenser ‚Äî this water can then be used to generate steam to initiate the evaporation process again.\nTo summarise:\n\nVacuum\nA vacuum is pulled in the evaporator to reduce the boiling point of the liquid. This means that temperatures as low as 60-70 ¬∞C can be used to generate vapour rather than the more severe 100¬∞C.\n\n\nEffects\n‚ÄúEffects‚Äù refer to stages in the evaporator where the liquid is concentrated, and in each stage there is some vapour removed. The liquid becomes more concentrated with each stage making it more difficult to evaporate water using hot vapour. For this reason, the pressure is reduced in each successive stage. There can be up to seven effects in a commercial evaporator ‚Äî the more effects that are used the greater the efficiency because more vapour (from the product) can be used as heating medium (instead of steam). This efficiency is an investment, as more effects increase capital costs.\n\n\nFilms\nLiquid is pumped to the top of the evaporator. From there, the liquid falls as a film down the inner walls of a long, vertical tube. The liquid is heated by steam circulating outside of the tube. As the liquid falls by gravity the vapour generated separates from the liquid. In most evaporators each stage consists of a large number of these tubes.\n\n\nCondenser\nVapour can be turned back into liquid water by a condenser. This water can then be used (boiled) to generate steam that can be used in the evaporation process."

Osmosis occurs when on one side of a membrane there is a high concentration of osmotically-active substances and on the other there is a low concentration. Common dissolved solids (or ‚Äúsolutes‚Äù), like salts, sugars and proteins, are osmotically-active. For example, when vegetables are added to a salty brine the high concentration of salt results in water moving (via osmosis) from the inside of cell membranes to the brine, resulting in a characteristic ‚Äúpickling‚Äù effect. In membrane-based concentration the opposite (or reverse) goal is pursued ‚Äî water must be removed from the solution containing osmotically-active components (salts, sugars, proteins, etc.). To achieve this pumps and valves are used to increase pressure on the concentrate side, overcoming osmosis.\n\nOsmosis: water flows from region of low solute concentration to high solute concentration due to natural osmotic pressure differences\nReverse osmosis: water flows from region of high solute concentration to low solute concentration due to pressures induced by pumps and valves\n\nReverse Osmosis may be favoured because it can be operated at even lower temperatures than vacuum evaporation (refrigeration to room temperature); however, membrane filtration processes are severely limited by viscosity development when concentration increases.

While you might be familiar with powders from the supermarket (e.g., milk powder, cocoa powder), massive quantities of powder are also traded between companies; for example, one company might supply cocoa powder to a second who uses it to make cake products."

For example, raisins do not resemble the grapes they are dried from and present a very different sensory experience. That drying results in such a transformation in structure can be considered a distinguishing feature relative to the operation of evaporation.\nDried foods like powders are inherently flexible, in that it is trivial for the user to alter concentration. For example, while milk contains protein it is difficult to use milk as a method of increasing the protein content of a food, because the addition of milk introduces a substantial quantity of water also. On the other hand, addition of milk powder can dramatically alter the protein content (and sugar content) of a product by varying its addition levels."

    "text": "Water Activity\nMost scientists do not consider drying to succeed as a method of shelf-life control due to its reduction in moisture content, but rather due to its reduction in water activity (\\(a_w\\)). Informally, water in a food system can be considered as either free or bound. Free water is equivalent to the pure water found in a glass and is expected to exert the same vapor pressure as that pure water. Bound water ‚Äî on the other hand ‚Äî is tightly associated with other food components (like proteins), which makes those bound water molecules less likely to vaporise (and thereby contribute to vapor pressure).\nAs a general observation then, pure water has a high vapor pressure while food systems have a relatively low vapor pressure; however, different food systems will have dramatically different vapor pressures, some close to water and some far from water. Water activity can then be defined based on vapor pressure (\\(V_p\\)) as:\n\\[a_w = \\frac{V_p \\ of \\ food}{V_p \\ of \\ pure \\ water}\\]\nwith:\n\\[0 < a_w < 1\\]\nThe drying of food can significantly reduce water activity (bring \\(a_w\\) closer to zero, which improves shelf-life). This can be thought of as reducing the amount of free water that would otherwise be available to support undesirable events, such as microbial growth and chemical changes.\nFor example, fresh meat has a water activity of 0.99 (close to water) while beef jerky has a value of <0.80. Liquid milk has a value of ~0.99 while milk powder has a value of <0.30. Water activity is a more reliable predictor of shelf-life than moisture content and it is known that some foods with the same moisture content can have dramatically different shelf-lives, due to their differing water activities.\nIn general, the rates of reactions and the extent of microbial growth increase with increasing water activity. It is also well known, however, that there are thresholds of water activity beyond which certain reactions or bacterial growth occur to a negligible degree. For example, there is limited bacterial growth when water activity is maintained below 0.9, while molds will not grow below 0.7. Notably, however, some chemical reactions can still proceed at very low water activity, such as browning (>0.2).\nA hygienically-produced powder then, with a water activity at least as low as 0.3, is far below the level where the growth of microorganisms can be expected; however, two important things should be noted at this point:\n\nPowders can still exhibit significant chemical changes during storage\nPowder prone to absorbing moisture from the air (e.g., high sugar) can exhibit increased water activity over time\n\nDespite these caveats, a well-manufactured powder should have a shelf-life of 12-24 months, especially if carefully packaged and stored."

    "text": "Spray-drying\nSome industrial drying systems resemble a common kitchen oven. The tray drier consists of heating elements, fans, food trays and an exhaust. The fan draws air into the drier, with the air being heated by the elements, before passing over the food, initiating evaporation of moisture. Moist vapor is then removed in the exhaust. Such systems can be augmented to optimise drying performance; for example, a vacuum pump can be used to reduce pressure in the drier and thereby decrease the temperatures the food needs to be expose to in order for drying to occur. Such a system is a batch method of drying and is not suitable for liquids.\nFor the continuous drying of liquid feeds the spray-drier is common. A spray drier consists of a large cylindrical chamber that tapers into a conical section at the bottom. Feed (typically concentrated feed from an evaporator) is pumped to the top of the vessel and through a nozzle. As the liquid passes through the nozzle it is transformed into a fine mist. This phenomenon is known as ‚Äúatomisation‚Äù and dramatically increases the surface area of the material to be dried. Hot air is simultaneously fed into the chamber, and the high temperature difference between the liquid and the air, combined with the large surface area of the droplets, results in rapid evaporation.\nThe exact temperatures vary according to the processor and the product, but generally the temperature of air at the inlet of the drier can be as high as 130¬∞C, while the temperature at the outlet can be as low as 65¬∞C. This difference reflects the impact of evaporative cooling, which occurs when heat energy contained in liquid water is lost in the vapor during evaporation. The impact of evaporative cooling also means ‚Äî importantly ‚Äî that the liquid being dried does not itself reach temperatures approaching the inlet temperature (which could cause significant quality degradation); in this regard, the outlet temperature (a much lower value) is more reflective of the moderate temperatures to which the components in the liquid are exposed.\nThe powder and exhaust typically pass into a cyclone where the (heavy) powder is separated from the (light) exhaust. In the exhaust will be entrained ‚Äúfines‚Äù, which are tiny powder particles. These fine particles may be recycled back into the drier (known as ‚Äúfines return‚Äù) to achieve agglomeration of particles ‚Äî this works by forcing collisions between fine dry particles and wet atomised droplets, which results in the formation of clusters (or ‚Äúagglomerates‚Äù) that are dried into large porous particles (usually with better functionality)."

    "text": "Viscosity as Momentum Flux\nUp to this point we have a limited concept of what viscosity is. Dimensional analysis can help us develop an intuition.\nEarlier we derived the following equation based on the two-plate system:\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = \\mu \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThis is sometimes written with a minus sign to represent that the velocity is decreasing as we move from the top plate to the bottom plate:\n\\[\\frac{F}{A} = -\\mu \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThis also yields an equation that is similar to a variety of other transfer equations used by engineers. For example, look at the resemblance between this equation and that describing the rate of heat transfer (\\(q\\)) through a body (the flow of heat from a warm to a cold region):\n\\[\\frac{q}{A} = -k \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta z}\\]\nThe fraction on the far left of the viscosity transfer equation represents shear stress and the fraction on the right is shear rate. Note that shear stress has the same formula as pressure; however, it is distinct from pressure. In physics you encounter the concept of scalars and vectors; the first has a magnitude but no direction while the former has a magnitude and a direction. We have conveniently been ignoring this distinction in order to avoid introducing unecessary complexity; for example, when discussing Stoke‚Äôs Law the velocity (a vector) either refers to a movement up (floating) or a movement down (sinking). On the other hand, when discussing pressure there is no associated direction; technically speaking, pressure is isotropic, meaning that pressure applied at a point is equal in all directions (the directions effectively cancel out). Shear stress is more like a vector than a scalar (to be precise it is a second-order tensor, but this is beyond our scope), in that it can be thought of as having an associated direction; for our purposes, the two directions can either be perpendicular to a surface (normal stress) or parallel to a surface (shear stress). The application of a shear stress to a liquid results in the liquid having a shear rate (it deforms in the direction of the shear stress).\nThe dimensions of shear stress are equivalent to pressure: \\([MLT^{-2}][L^{-2}]\\).\nThese dimensions are equivalent to the following: \\([MLT^{-1}][T^{-1}][L^{-2}]\\).\nFrom left to right, this reads ‚Äúmomentum per time per area‚Äù, also known as ‚Äúmomentum flux‚Äù.\nNote that momentum \\(p\\) is defined usually as \\(p = m \\cdot v\\) (mass times velocity).\nThe physical meaning of momentum flux in the context of viscosity can be explained as follows:\n\nThe top layer of liquid has the greatest velocity and therefore the greatest momentum. The lowest layer of the liquid has the lowest momentum. As the liquid is sheared from left to right momentum is transferred top-down. Layers with higher momentum lose momentum to layers with lower momentum. This results in a gradual loss of momentum between the top and bottom plate.\n\nTherefore there is shear being applied horizontally at the surface of the liquid and momentum transferring downwards."

The mathematics and physics knowledge required is not advanced.\n\nVolumetric Flow-rate\nFlow-rate for liquids is usually given the symbol \\(Q\\) and is defined as:\n\\[Q = \\frac{V}{t}\\]\nThe units are most commonly \\(L \\ h^{-1}\\) or \\(m^3 \\ h^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWriting \\(L \\ h^{-1}\\) is equivalent to \\(L/h\\).\nSimilarly, \\(m \\ s^{-2}\\) ‚Äî the units of acceleration ‚Äî can also be written \\(m/s^{2}\\).\nDo not let the exponents and negative numbers confuse you and rewrite them if it helps.\n\n\nA common method of measuring flow-rate in a lab is to periodically measure the volume collected over a certain period of time. For example, if 300 mL is collected from a pipe in 30 seconds we could convert this to a flow-rate by first converting mL ‚Üí L:\n\\[\\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3 \\ L\\]\nThis means that 0.3 L is collected per 30 s, but we need the volume in an hour, so we do the following:\n\\[0.3 \\times 2 \\times 60 = 36 \\ L \\ h^{-1}\\]\nThis quantity is known sometimes as the ‚Äúvolumetric flow-rate‚Äù. If units for mass (e.g., kg) are used instead then it ‚Äúmass flow rate‚Äù.\n\n\nVelocity of flow\nThe volumetric flow-rate (\\(Q\\)) has the units \\(m^3 \\ s^{-1}\\).\nWe know that a common way of expressing velocity is meters-per-second. From the units above we can expect that to calculate velocity of flow we simply divide \\(Q\\) by an area \\(A\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can we ‚Äúexpect‚Äù this? Because to convert \\(m^3\\) to \\(m\\) (or \\(m^1\\)) we need to divide by \\(m^2\\), when these values are divided the exponents subtract like so: \\(\\frac{m^3}{m^2} = m^{3-2} = m^1 = m\\).\n\n\n\n\\[v = \\frac{Q}{A}\\]\nThe area in this case is the cross-sectional area of flow. In food engineering calculations this is nearly always the area of a disc (because we are usually dealing with pipes).\nThe velocity is often required in equations where the flow-rate cannot be used (you need to understand that they are different). For example, the Reynold‚Äôs number used to define turbulence uses velocity not flow-rate.\nVelocity is a vector quantity, so to be more precise we could write \\(\\overrightarrow{v}\\). It also represents an average value, meaning that it represents the statistical average of a range of individual velocities. How this is normally represented is that a fluid moving through a pipe consists of stream-lines, each flowing in a specific direction. In laminar (non-turbulent) flow the maximum velocity is in the centre and the velocity at the edges is \\(0\\). This means that liquids flows in a ‚Äúcurved‚Äù fashion, with the fastest streamlines in the centre."

This is a basic ‚Äúshell-and-tube‚Äù heat exchanger.\nOver time heat transfers from the hot liquid to the cold liquid. This kind of equipment is often used to reduce levels of bacteria in a liquid. Depending on the bacteria present, specific time-temperature combinations are required. For example, a common pasteurisation treatment is 72¬∞C √ó 15s.\nExposing the liquid to this temperature for 15s will be expected to reduce bacteria to a safe level. That is: if a bacteria takes 15s to pass through a section of the pipe where the temperature is 72¬∞ then it will be inactivated. It is important that all of the product is heated at this temperature for 15s to ensure it is safe, but it is also desirable not to exceed this time (if possible) as it can cause quality loss.\nHere is the issue: in laminar conditions, the liquid is not all moving at a uniform velocity. Therefore, the bacteria present in the liquid are moving at different velocities and will therefore move through the heat exchanger in different times. This also means that there is no guarantee that a given bacteria will be exposed to the target temperature for 15s.\n\n\nTheory\nThe volumetric flow-rate is defined as \\(Q = \\frac{V}{t}\\). From this equation we can take the residence time to be:\n\\[t = \\frac{Q}{V}\\]\nThe target is \\(t (s) = 15\\).\nThe average velocity (\\(v_{AVE}\\)) is given by \\(v_{AVE} = \\frac{Q}{A}\\). The average residence time (\\(t_{AVE}\\)) can be calculated by dividing tube length (\\(L\\)) by average velocity:\n\\[t_{AVE} = \\frac{L \\ (m)}{v_{AVE} \\ (ms^{-1})}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough there is one value for average velocity in reality the liquid moves at a different velocity depending on its position in the tube.\nSimilarly, there is an average residence time but in reality there is a distribution of residence times.\n\n\nIn laminar conditions (\\(Re < 2100\\)) the maximum velocity (\\(v_{MAX}\\)) is approximately double the average velocity:\n\\[v_{MAX} = 2 \\cdot v_{AVE}\\]\nThe average residence time at \\(v_{AVE}\\) is 15s. It takes 15s for the average particle moving at this velocity to traverse the pipe. How long does it take a particle that is double the speed? The answer is: half the value (7.5s), which is the minimum time (\\(t_{MIN})\\):\n\\[t_{MIN} = \\frac{t_{AVE}}{2}\\]\nThis means that there is a population of bacteria that have half the necessary residence time.\n\n\nSolution\nOne solution is simply to double the treatment time. If the liquid is heated for 30s, then the fastest moving particles will receive the necessary treatment time of 15s.\nHowever, this is not ideal, as the average particle will be exposed to a high temperature for twice the time that is necessary, which can lead to quality issues (e.g., cooked flavours, discolouration). While the product will be safe, it may not be acceptable from a sensory perspective.\nThe preferred solution is to ensure that the flow is turbulent. In turbulent flow the distribution of velocities is less wide. The fastest moving particles are only 1.2 times as fast as the average:\n\\[v_{MAX} = 1.2 \\cdot v_{AVE}\\]\nThis means that their residence time is approximately 0.8 times the treatment time, compared to 0.5 times for laminar flow.\nSo, instead of an increased time of \\(2 \\times 15s\\) only \\(1.2 \\times 15s\\) is needed. In turbulent conditions, a heating time of 18s results in the fastest moving particles receiving the heat treatment for 15s, while minimising negative quality effects associated with prolonged heating."

It is common to see single values for bulk density reported, but it is important to remember that each powder has - essentially - a bulk density graph.\nA powder exerts a self-weight on itself. This means that the stresses created within the powder can result in time-consolidation, and when the powder becomes compressed its bulk density will increase. The mechanism involves some combination of particle reorientation and the void-filling action of small particles, which is the subject of continued work in the literature.\n\n\n\nExample of a bulk density curve for two different powders. The green curve indicates a high density powder that as a low compressibility, while the red curve indicates a low density powder with a high compressibility\n\n\nThe test for measuring bulk density is common, inexpensive and simple. A known mass of powder is filled into a graduated cylinder, which is then tapped a specific amount of times. The difference in volume between consecutive tappings gives an indication of the compressibility. Changes in bulk density during the course of a food process can also be used to probe the origins of quality defects. For example, an agglomerated powder may have an altered bulk density or compressibility owing to particle breakage occurring during pneumatic conveying - by measuring these properties before and after conveying the root-cause of this issue can be identified.\n\n\n\nThere can be air within and between particles, which has a significant impact on bulk density. Changes in bulk density can have a knock-on effect for the nutrient density of scooped powders\n\n\n\n\nFlowability\nThe flowability of a powder consists of a complex set of properties that determine the relative ease with which it can be stored in vessels and moved between vessels. Any of the following might be considered problems caused by poor flowability:\n\nThe formation of a stable arch at the outlet of a hopper that prevents flow\nThe development of stagnant regions of powder at the inner walls of a silo\nThe tendency of a powder to suddenly ‚Äúflood‚Äù or avalanche when poured\nThe onset of stickiness in a powder during storage\nThe segregation of powders (particularly power mixtures) based on particle size or density\n\nEach of these problems in their own right has an extensive scientific and engineering literature that covers their various intricacies. It won‚Äôt be possible to cover all of these issues here, so later we will try to drive towards some of the major recurrent concepts and issues.\n\n\nSome important particle properties\n\nParticle shape\nTaken broadly, food powders have an enormous variety of particle shapes. While milk powders and protein concentrates contain approximately spherical particles, herbs and spices contain a variety of shapes ranging from fibres to stars. Salt crystals are cubic, and so on.\nTo an extent, the shape is determined by the processor. For example, the shape of a milk powder can be controlled during the agglomeration step. The shape formed during manufacture is not fixed, however, and can undergo changes during handling. Critically, with respect to agglomerates, they can become fragmented when colliding with solid surfaces, especially during conveying. The friability of agglomerates is determined by their shape, with compact shapes being more stable than branching, irregular ones.\nGiven the large size of powder particles (micrometre to millimetre scale) it is relatively cheap for a company to invest in shape characterisation. In most cases a cheap light microscope will suffice. I have had some success using a light microscope and video camera attachment purchased from Amazon, so there is not a huge barrier to entry here. Free software is also available online to process the resultant images and data. More expensive methods of shape characterisation have recently been developed that offer more immediate statistical power. If you are considering one of these options my suggestion would be to try a light microscope first - if you are not using one of these already why would you consider a more expensive and sophisticated option?\n\n\n\nParticles in powders can range widely in terms of shape\n\n\n\n\nParticle size\nOne of the most commonly measured values for food powders is particle size. A general rule-of-thumb is that powders with larger particle sizes flow better. However, a direct correlation between particle size and flowability has never been demonstrated for a set of powders, indicating that flowability cannot be reduced to this property alone.\nIn terms of solubility, it is also generally the case that larger particle sizes are associated with more soluble powders, but the cause of the large particle size must be considered. An agglomerated powder is not more soluble by virtue of its large particle diameter, it is more soluble because of the channels created between smaller particles during agglomeration. So we can determined that a powder has been agglomerated by measuring size, which is a predictor of solubility, but a non-agglomerated powder with a large particle size is not necessarily a very soluble powder.\nParticle size is also increasingly a method to track the dispersion of particles during rehydration. This is the slowest part of the process for certain powders. If you are working with a powder that is slow to disperse having a reliable method to track the process can be an important first step in solving the problem. Light-scattering equipment like the Malvern Mastersizer are common in QC labs and in the food industry are probably most commonly used for measuring oil droplet size to determine emulsion stability. However, they can also be used for measuring powder particle size before, during and after rehydration. Thus, while a comparatively low-tech option like a sieve stack can adequately measure the particle size of dry powders, light-scattering techniques can be more flexibly applied to a broader range of problems.\n\n\nSurface composition\nThe composition of a particle in a non-segregated powder is taken to be equivalent to the bulk composition of the whole powder. We expect that if we take a whey protein isolate it will have a protein content of around 90%, and that each particle will also have this approximate composition.\nThis is not a guarantee that the surface composition is equivalent to the bulk though. In powders like these, even when there is a high protein content, the surface can be found to be enriched in other molecules, like water and lipids. This is important to remember for at least two reasons:\n\nThe molecules can facilitate particle-particle interactions that cause flow issues\nThe presence of hydrophobic materials at the surface can repel water during rehydration\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of liquid water of fat on particle surfaces builds cohesion between particles\n\n\nThe factors that influence surface composition are numerous. In sugar-rich powders, water sorption by amorphous sugars can lead to crystallisation and the release of water into the bulk. In lipid-rich powders, elevated temperatures during storage or transport have been shown to cause the release of liquid fat on particle surfaces. In both cases, there would be a consequence for flowability and solubility. Methods to measure surface properties have become more common in the literature, especially x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. If access to such equipment is not possible it is worth keeping in mind that the stickiness issue in your high-protein powder could be a fat issue, and to experiment with solving this problem experimentally, i.e., do fat-targeting surfactants help (?), or does the issue become more pronounced above the melting point of the principal fats in your powder?\n\n\n\nComponents can be differentially distributed across the particle structure, affecting functionality"

    "section": "Flow problems",
    "text": "Flow problems\nIn a powder at rest there are stresses acting vertically and horizontally. Unlike in a liquid, the extent of these stresses is not necessarily equal. The vertical stresses tend to predominate, but occasionally the horizontal stresses can drive materials to the silo walls. The section of a silo where the walls converge is known as the hopper, and in this region some of the vertical stresses can be transferred radially outwards to the hopper walls. This arching effect is similar to architectural arches, which can hold a greater load than a horizontal beam because of the radial stresses in the arch. An arch like this can be very difficult to unblock.\n\n\n\nThe green curve illustrates what we would expect for a silo containing pure water, with stress increasing linearly with depth. The behaviour is far more complex for a powder (blue) in which regions of low stress can develop at the outlet, causing blockages\n\n\nArching is common in hoppers that are designed for mass flow. These usually have steep walls designed so that the first material that is added to a silo is the first material that leaves it. Hoppers that are not designed this way may exhibit core flow, in which the first material added is the last to be discharged. This results in a large proportion of the internal volume of the silo consisting of stagnant powder. A narrow core in this volume is where the powder flows through. This phenomenon is sometimes called rat-holing.\nBoth arching and rat-holing are problematic for different reasons. Arching can effectively halt a process. Rat-holing, on the other hand, reduces the effective capacity of the silo and can cause quality deterioration in the stagnant zones. They can technically be resolved by appropriate silo design. Given the dynamic nature of food processing, it may not always be possible to have a perfectly designed hopper for each and every use-case. However, analytical methods including powder flow testers can give data on the propensity of a powder to exhibit these flow problems, which can inform procurement decisions or manufacturing strategies.\n\n\n\nA silo can be divided between bin and hopper sections. Steep hopper walls are required to facilitate mass flow - if this condition is not met core-flow will result\n\n\n\nWhen powders are and aren‚Äôt like water\nWhen you dive deep into a body of water the pressure acting on your body increases linearly. This is not true of powders. Strangely, if you keep adding powder to a silo, and continuously weigh the quantity of powder added, a point will be reached where there is apparently no further increase in weight as powder is added. This was recognised many years ago by the German engineer H.A. Janssen, and relates to the fact that some of the weight of the powder is transmitted laterally towards the walls, which - in effect - ‚Äúhold it up‚Äù.\n\n\n\nThe original experiment of Janssen, showing that at some point as a vessel is being filled with grain it stops registering a weight increase\n\n\nIf the powder is divided into discrete chunks or ‚Äúslices‚Äù, similar to a situation where there are stacks of powder in a warehouse or factory floor, then the behaviour is more similar to water. You should keep in mind in these cases that there is a linear increase in compressive stress as the depth increases in this stack. This means that bags positioned toward the bottom of the stack are more likely to undergo negative changes associated with compression.\n\n\n\nWhen a volume of powder is divided into discrete chunks the vertical pressure or stress (\\(P_v\\)) can be calculated as per a liquid. A modified version of the classic equation for hydrostatic pressure can be used for non-discrete masses of powder when supplemented with additional parameters, including a wall friction value (\\(\\mu_w\\)) obtainable from shear cell testing.\n\n\n\n\nStudying Flowability\nThere are many basic tests for flowability that despite being relatively inexpensive but are still uncommonly used in practice.\nThe angle of repose involves allowing a known quantity of powder to flow through a funnel and fall a specific height onto a flat surface. The angle between the top of the pile and the horizontal surface is then measured. The smaller the angle the greater the propensity to flow.\nThe compressibility can be measured based on data from a standard tapped bulk density test. The degree to which a powder is compressible is taken to be the extent to which the bulk volume (and bulk density by extension) changes during tapping. A powder that is more compressible is more likely to cake during storage and transport.\nOther tests like the angle of spatula and the angle of fall are also used on occasion but the reader can investigate these similarly low-tech options themselves, as information on their use is freely available online.\n\n\n\nAngle of repose test\n\n\nMore powerful but expensive are shear cell testers. There is a number of such devices available, including the Jenike tester, the Schulze ring tester, the Brookfield powder flow tester and Freeman Technology‚Äôs powder rheometer. All of these devices vary widely in terms of their cost and ease-of-use. The last two options are probably the most accessible option from a routine testing point of view.\nThese flow testers basically function by applying a vertical stress to a volume of the powder to be tested. This vertical stress is applied until a precise degree of compression is achieved. At this point the powder is subject to shearing forces and the shear required for the powder to ‚Äúfail‚Äù (or flow) is measured. This process is then repeated at multiple compression loads to generate a flow function. The steeper the flow function curve the more cohesive the powder is. the powder is measured prior to the experiment and the device measures the powder volume during testing, meaning that it generates a bulk density curve. The combination of stress and bulk density data allows estimations to be made as to what design requirements might be need for the powder to flow effectively from a hopper. In addition, a special wall friction geometry can be used to determine the degree to which the powder will flow against the stainless steel surfaces found in hoppers and silos.\n\n\n\nExample output from a shear cell test with results for a very cohesive and an easy flowing powder\n\n\n\nStorage\nIn both cases it has been recognised that the manufacture and storage of these powders can have a dramatic impact on their subsequent rehydration performance. Generally, it is preferable that powders be stored in such a way that there is limited water absorption from the surrounding air. In addition, low temperature storage of powders promotes a better retention of solubility (and flowability) for that matter.\nAn interesting case study is an Irish producer of dairy powders for export. After freshly manufacturing a dairy powder it is tested in the lab and found to have excellent rehydration performance. Subsequently, it is exported to its destination in another country and found to have terrible rehydration performance. So what happened? Well, it is likely that en route to its destination it was exposed to temperatures far in excess of the average Irish laboratory. In a truck in a warm country the ambient temperature can easily exceed 50 degrees Celsius, temperatures which are known to cause negative effects on powder solubility. In the absence of a means to ensure refrigerated trucking of the powders, lab functionality tests may need to factor in temperature abuse occurring during transit.\n\n\nManufacturing\nThe intricacies of powder manufacture are such that it is not possible to give a detailed account of a range of powders and the strategies that can be employed to influence rehydration performance. At best, we can focus on some powders that we at UCC have spent some time researching. One such set of powders is Milk Protein Concentrates (MPCs) and related powders (Micellar Casein Concentrates, Milk Protein Isolates). The manufacturing process for an MPC is relatively straightforward:\n\nPasteurise milk\nUltrafilter/diafilter to concentrate protein\nEvaporate to remove water\nSpray dry to generate powder\n\nThe underlying causes are still unclear, but somewhere between 2 and 3 a set of physicochemical changes occur that result in these powders being very slow to rehydrate.\nWhat is known is that the during ultrafiltration much of the volume of the suspension becomes occupied with casein micelles, which are pushed close together. In addition, the mineral profile of the suspension is dramatically changed, especially when water is added during diafiltration.\nWhen the suspensions are evaporated the caseins are pushed even closer together. After drying, MPC powders can consist of particles that contain casein micelles fused tightly together at their surface. These kinds of particles are then very slow to disperse. This effect seems to become worse in non-ideal storage conditions (i.e., eleveated temperature).\nA non-exhaustive list of strategies to address this problem are categorised below:\n\nDuring manufacture:\n\nDiafilter with mineral solutions: this seems to limit the influence of changes in mineral equilibrium on resultant solubility issues and is the subject of a number of patents\nHigh-shear treatment pre-drying: this has been shown in some studies to result in less aggregation of micelles during evaporation and dryiung. A variety of tools have been tested, including high pressure homogenisation and ultrasonication\nAgglomeration of the powder: a traditional approach to improving powder solubility. This improves the wetting of MPCs but can worsen their dispersibility, which is a net loss in rehydration capacity.\n\nAfter manufacture:\n\nDissolution in mineral solutions: this might involve rehydrating the powder in salt solutions, chelator preparations or even milk (if making a high-protein milk). This, of course, may have an impact on composition and nutritional properties. In the case of using chelators, it can fundamentally alter the functionality of the ingredient\nHigh energy mixing: a common approach, where temperature is elevated to ~50C in combination with rapid agitation. More sophisticated (but expensive) technologies like ultrasonication have also been demonstrated to work in research.\nChoice of lower protein MPCs: most of the issues relating to solubility are encountered when protein content exceeds 75%. When it comes to MPCs there are a variety of them available, ranging from 40% to 90% protein. A question that should be asked when formulating a product using one of these powders is: how high does the protein content need to be in this ingredient for our application? Exceeding 80% protein may required further effort and investment to ensure the powder isn‚Äôt creating problems in your product.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring rehydration\nA large range of techniques have been developed in recent years to study rehydration dynamically, including particle sizing, conductivity testing and air release measurements. The applicability of these methods to different stages is illustrated graphically below.\nIn terms of measuring whether a powder has fully solubilised, the standard tests still apply. An effective method is to apply a gentle centrifugation after a period of rehydration. This will separate the insoluble material from the solution. If you have prepared a 10% solids solution then the solids content of the solution after centrifugation should be 10%. This is an easy test, but the key thing to remember is that you must apply the test after the powder has been exposed to relevant rehydration conditions.\n\n\n\nThe stages of rehydration and their measurement"
