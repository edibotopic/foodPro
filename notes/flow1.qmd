# Flow

Processes consist of a series of operations, each with an input and output.
Materials flow between operations, and in modern food factories this flow is often continuous.
A high rate of flow is often desired because it ensures a process is efficient (ratio of value flow out to value flow in).
Changes in flow-rate ‚Äî especially decreases ‚Äî often indicate a problem, such as equipment blockage or material supply issues.
The flow of food liquids is complex and involves an interplay between equipment properties (pipe geometry), food characteristics (viscosity) and flow behaviour (turbulence).
Carefully controlling these factors can allow effective operations like homogenisation to be designed.

## Quantities

There some quantities that are used to define flow that are important to remember.
Please review the equations outlined below and try to understand them.
The mathematics and physics knowledge required is not advanced.

### Volumetric Flow-rate

Flow-rate for liquids is usually given the symbol $Q$ and is defined as:

$$Q = \frac{V}{t}$$

The units are most commonly $L \ h^{-1}$ or $m^3 \ h^{-1}$.

::: {.callout-note}

Writing $L \ h^{-1}$ is equivalent to $L/h$.

Similarly, $m \ s^{-2}$ ‚Äî the units of acceleration ‚Äî can also be written $m/s^{2}$.

Do not let the exponents and negative numbers confuse you and rewrite them if it helps.

:::

A common method of measuring flow-rate in a lab is to periodically measure the volume collected over a certain period of time.
For example, if 300 mL is collected from a pipe in 30 seconds we could convert this to a flow-rate by first converting mL ‚Üí L:

$$\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3 \ L$$

This means that 0.3 L is collected per 30 s, but we need the volume in an hour, so we do the following:

$$0.3 \times 2 \times 60 = 36 \ L \ h^{-1}$$

This quantity is known sometimes as the "volumetric flow-rate".
If units for mass (e.g., kg) are used instead then it "mass flow rate".

### Velocity of flow

The volumetric flow-rate ($Q$) has the units $m^3 \ s^{-1}$.

We know that a common way of expressing velocity is meters-per-second.
From the units above we can expect that to calculate velocity of flow we simply divide $Q$ by an area $A$:

::: {.callout}
Why can we "expect" this? Because to convert $m^3$ to $m$ (or $m^1$) we need to divide by $m^2$, when these values are divided the exponents subtract like so: $\frac{m^3}{m^2} = m^{3-2} = m^1 = m$.
:::

$$v = \frac{Q}{A}$$

The area in this case is the cross-sectional area of flow.
In food engineering calculations this is nearly always the area of a disc (because we are usually dealing with pipes).

The velocity is often required in equations where the flow-rate cannot be used (you need to understand that they are different).
For example, the Reynold's number used to define turbulence uses velocity not flow-rate.

Velocity is a `vector` quantity, so to be more precise we could write $\overrightarrow{v}$.
It also represents an `average` value, meaning that it represents the statistical average of a range of individual velocities.
How this is normally represented is that a fluid moving through a pipe consists of `stream-lines`, each flowing in a specific direction.
In `laminar` (non-turbulent) flow the maximum velocity is in the centre and the velocity at the edges is $0$.
This means that liquids flows in a "curved" fashion, with the fastest streamlines in the centre.

## Turbulence

Turbulence represents phenomena associated with the chaotic motion of fluids.

A high degree of turbulence is often desirable in many food operations, such as heating and mixing.
Turbulence is calculated from a famous equation that returns the Re(ynold's) number:

$$Re = \frac{v \rho D}{\mu}$$

Note that viscosity is below the line, meaning that a lower degree of turbulence is often observed in viscous systems.

For our purposes it might be sufficient to remember that turbulence is proportional to velocity (it increases when velocity increases):

$$Re ‚àù v$$

and inversely proportional to viscosity (it decreases when viscosity increases):

$$Re ‚àù \frac{1}{\mu}$$

When a liquid is pumped at a high velocity it is more likely to transition into chaotic motion, which can be preferable in specific situations:

- Turbulence can decrease the tendency for particles to form deposits on equipment surfaces
- Turbulence can increase the rate of heat transfer during thermal processing
- Turbulence can promote the disintegration of particles

## Velocity, Turbulence and Residence Time

### Problem

Consider a pipe through which a cold liquid flows.
The pipe is surrounded by a shell through which a hot liquid flows.
This is a basic "shell-and-tube" heat exchanger.

Over time heat transfers from the hot liquid to the cold liquid.
This kind of equipment is often used to reduce levels of bacteria in a liquid.
Depending on the bacteria present, specific time-temperature combinations are required.
For example, a common pasteurisation treatment is 72¬∞C √ó 15s.

Exposing the liquid to this temperature for 15s will be expected to reduce bacteria to a safe level.
That is: if a bacteria takes 15s to pass through a section of the pipe where the temperature is 72¬∞ then it will be inactivated.
It is important that all of the product is heated at this temperature for 15s to ensure it is safe, but it is also desirable not to exceed this time (if possible) as it can cause quality loss.

Here is the issue: in laminar conditions, the liquid is not all moving at a uniform velocity.
Therefore, the bacteria present in the liquid are moving at different velocities and will therefore move through the heat exchanger in different times.
This also means that there is no guarantee that a given bacteria will be exposed to the target temperature for 15s.

### Theory

The volumetric flow-rate is defined as $Q = \frac{V}{t}$.
From this equation we can take the residence time to be:

$$t = \frac{Q}{V}$$

The target is $t (s) = 15$.

The average velocity ($v_{AVE}$) is given by $v_{AVE} = \frac{Q}{A}$.
The average residence time ($t_{AVE}$) can be calculated by dividing tube length ($L$) by average velocity:

$$t_{AVE} = \frac{L \ (m)}{v_{AVE} \ (ms^{-1})}$$

::: {.callout-note}
Although there is one value for average velocity in reality the liquid moves at a different velocity depending on its position in the tube.

Similarly, there is an average residence time but in reality there is a distribution of residence times.
:::

In laminar conditions ($Re < 2100$) the maximum velocity ($v_{MAX}$) is approximately double the average velocity:

$$v_{MAX} = 2 \cdot v_{AVE}$$

The average residence time at $v_{AVE}$ is 15s.
It takes 15s for the average particle moving at this velocity to traverse the pipe.
How long does it take a particle that is double the speed?
The answer is: half the value (7.5s), which is the minimum time ($t_{MIN})$:

$$t_{MIN} = \frac{t_{AVE}}{2}$$

This means that there is a population of bacteria that have half the necessary residence time.

### Solution

One solution is simply to double the treatment time.
If the liquid is heated for 30s, then the fastest moving particles will receive the necessary treatment time of 15s.

However, this is not ideal, as the average particle will be exposed to a high temperature for twice the time that is necessary, which can lead to quality issues (e.g., cooked flavours, discolouration).
While the product will be safe, it may not be acceptable from a sensory perspective.

The preferred solution is to ensure that the flow is turbulent.
In turbulent flow the distribution of velocities is less wide.
The fastest moving particles are only 1.2 times as fast as the average:

$$v_{MAX} = 1.2 \cdot v_{AVE}$$

This means that their residence time is approximately 0.8 times the treatment time,
compared to 0.5 times for laminar flow.

So, instead of an increased time of $2 \times 15s$ only $1.2 \times 15s$ is needed.
In turbulent conditions, a heating time of 18s results in the fastest moving particles receiving the heat treatment for 15s, while minimising negative quality effects associated with prolonged heating.
