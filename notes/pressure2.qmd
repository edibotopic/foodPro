## Draft

These notes will be updated later in the week.

For now I am focusing on the Excel tutorial that will be uploaded later this week.

:::

This week's lab practical focuses on the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which can
be used to explain how hydrostatic pressure influences flow-rate.

Please review the notes that are provided for the laboratory practical.

Re-arranging the equation also provides a simple means of calculating/measuring viscosity.
Slides are available below, which will be supplemented with additional info during the class.
