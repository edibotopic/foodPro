There is a pressure drop across an object submerged in a fluid.
Pressure is lowest at the top of the object and highest at the bottom.
This pressure difference results in a buoyant force on the object.

Pressure plays an important role throughout food processing.
To understand pressure it is important to build up our understanding from simple to more complex cases.

Several food processing operations require high pressures, including:

- Homogenisation: 30-300 bar
- Reverse Osmosis: 40-80 bar
- Ultrafiltration: 2-10 bar

Other food processes require reduced pressures, such a vacuum evaporation, distillation and freeze-drying.

## Pressure in Static Fluids

Pressure ($P$) is defined as:

$$P = \frac{F}{A}$$

This gives $P$ the dimensions $[M LT^{-2} L^{-2}]$ or ‚Äî more simply ‚Äî $[M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$.

Consider a liquid in a container in which there is no submerged object.
In such a system the pressure at a given point can be calculated as:

$$P = \rho g h$$

The $\rho$ corresponds to the density of the liquid and $h$ the height from the surface.
As usual, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Dimensions Check

Does the second equation above yield the dimensions you expect?

:::

The equation should *ring true* intuitively if you have ever experienced the increase in pressure when diving deeper into water.
Nonetheless, it is counter-intuitive to many that it is merely the height (and not the volume) of water that determines the pressure.
In practice, this means that very narrow columns of fluid can generate enormous pressures if the column is high enough (the hydrostatic paradox).

::: {.callout-important}

## Intuition Behind the Pressure Equation

Intuitively we have some notion that $P$ is associated with the weight $W$ of liquid.
So we might expect (wrongly) that

$$P = W$$

However, this cannot be correct because weight is a force not a pressure.
So we might write:

$$F = W$$

This is correct, but does not seem to tell us what we want to know, which
is how to calculate $P$.
Now, to move forward we need to first consider that
$\frac{F}{A} =  P$, so we know that we need to ultimately divide our $F$ 
value by an area ($A$) value.
Obviously, there is no $A$ value on the right-side of the equation,
so we need to find one.
To do this we consider that $W = m.a$ and in the
liquid column the acceleration is due to gravity:

$$F = m.g$$

Next, we recognise that $m = œÅV$, so that:

$$F = œÅ.V.g$$

Remember, we would like to find an $A$ value on the right side, so where
is it?
Well, consider that the dimensions of $V$ are $L^3$, which can be the
product of an area with dimensions $L^2$ and a length ($l$) with dimensions
$L$.
So we can re-write the equation as:

$$F = œÅ.A.l.g$$

The $A$ value must refer to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (i.e., a
circle), while the $l$ value must refer to the height ($h$) of liquid.
The volume of a cylinder is the product of the cross-sectional area by its height.
Now, we can replace $l$ by $h$ and divide both sides by $A$:

$$\frac{F}{A} = P = œÅ.h.g$$

## Pressure Head

There is one simple way of re-arranging the equation for hydrostatic pressure that is important to note.
If both sides of the equation are divided by the product of $\rho$ and $g$ then we get the following:

$$h = \frac{P}{\rho g}$$

This is known as the "pressure head" and tells us the height of a column of liquid that can be supported by a given pressure.

::: {.callout}

If atmospheric pressure is $101325 \ kg \ m^{-1} \ s^{-2}$, $g$ is $9.81 \ m \ s^{-2}$ and the density of water is $1000 \ kg \ m^{-3}$, estimate the height of a column of water
that can be supported at atmospheric pressure.

Assume that

$$h = \frac{P}{\rho g}$$

Plugging in values:

$$h = \frac{101325}{1000 \cdot 9.81}$$

$h = 10.3 \ m$

Thus, the tendency of a column of liquid of a specific height to be supported by liquid at a specific pressure allows height
(or "pressure head") to be used as an index of pressure.
The greater the pressure the greater the height.
This is the basis of traditional *barometers* used to measure pressure, where a more dense liquid (e.g., mercury) is used
to ensure that the barometer does not need to be excessively large as an instrument (can you tell from the equation why this is so?).

We will encounter pressure head again when looking at Bernoulli's equation, so you may need to return to these notes.

## Absolute and Gauge Pressure

In the tour of the processing facilities at UCC several pressure gauges were shown.
These gauges were reading $0 \ bar$, yet atmospheric pressure is approximately $1 \ bar$.
If the pressure was really zero then the processing facility would be in a vacuum.

The simple reason for this is that these pressure gauges do not give a readout of *absolute* pressure.
Instead, they provide what is known as *gauge* pressure.

Gauge pressure is simply the pressure of the system **minus** the atmospheric pressure.
Hence, if you want to convert a gauge pressure to absolute pressure you **add** the atmospheric pressure.

For example, the (gauge) pressure at the bottom of a tank of liquid is given by $P = \rho g h$ but to
calculate the absolute pressure ($P_A$) we would use $P_A = P_S + \rho g h$, where $P_S$ is the 
pressure acting on the surface of the liquid (atmospheric).

It is important to note that this distinction does not matter when it comes to **pressure drop**.
To make sense of this statement, please review the box below.

::: {.callout-note}

## Pressure drop

Consider a pipe through which a liquid is flowing from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure.
The first gauge reads $2.0 \ bar$ and the second gauge reads $1.5 \ bar$.
The pressure drop is therefore $2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \ bar$.

Now consider the same calculation, but this time we convert any gauge pressure into an absolute pressure
by adding $1.0 \ bar$:

$$(2.0 + 1.0) - (1.5 + 1.0) = 0.5 \ bar$$

As you can see, when determining pressure drop (often what we are interested in) this distinction is unimportant.

## From Static to Movement

Fluid statics concerns the state of fluids "at rest" (not moving);
however, as we saw in the example of Stoke's law, we usually use 
these static systems is simplified models that help us understand
more complex (moving) systems.
So, while pressure can be created in a static liquid, we need to
consider how this pressure can ultimately impact motion.

A tank containing a liquid will exert pressure on the walls of the tank.
The pressure will be greatest the deeper we dive below the surface.
Place a pressure gauge just below the surface and one just above the bottom and
there will be a difference in pressure.

Now imagine there is a hole at the bottom of the tank.
The pressure of the water inside the tank is high; however,
the pressure outside the hole is the atmospheric pressure.
As the pressure at the bottom of the tank is greater than the
atmospheric pressure there will be a pressure drop from inside to outside.

This will also be true if we connect a pipe to the hole.
The pressure at the start of the pipe is the pressure due to the depth of liquid (high),
while the pressure at the end of the pipe is the pressure due to the atmosphere (low).

As you might expect, liquid will flow through the pipe, with the rate of flow determined by the pressure drop.
While not a "pump" in the classic sense, this is the simplest model of a pump we can think of.
To get liquid to flow from one location to another we need a pressure drop.
Here, the pressure drop is created due to the height of the liquid above an outlet.

Several questions can be raised at this point:

- To what extent does pressure drop determine flow-rate?
- How does viscosity influence flow-rate?
- Which pressure gauges are avaiable and how should they be selected?

To answer some of these questions we will again need to shift slightly between statics and dynamics
before focusing on dynamics in a dedicated way.

## Question

Write the equation for hydrostatic pressure.

Show that it yields the correct dimensions for pressure.

Re-arrange the equation into a form for measuring "pressure head".

Explain why the latter form of the equation is useful.
