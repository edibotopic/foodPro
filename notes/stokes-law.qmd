`Fluid Statics` is the science of liquid systems at rest.
The fact that the liquid is "at rest" does not mean nothing is happening.

As this topic can get quite technical we will start with a relevant food example that
brings together some concepts we have encountered already.

In food processing it is often in our interest to exploit some kind of *productive difference*.
Successful exploitation of such differences allow us to generate a useful change.
Productive differences and the changes they induce are often captured in equations.
Dimensional analysis can help us to reason about these equations.

These ideas are here reinforced with the example of systems in which particles are dispersed in a liquid.

# Pressure, Density and Buoyancy 

In a liquid, the pressure increases with depth from the surface.
When an object is submerged in a liquid there is more pressure at its bottom than at its top.
This pressure drop results in the phenomenon of *buoyancy*, which is the
tendency of a liquid to exert an upward force on a submerged object
that opposes the object's weight (which would otherwise tend to pull it downards).
The force is equivalent to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

::: {.callout}

Remember, weight is mass times gravitational acceleration, and therefore a force ($F = ma$).

:::

The density of the object determines if it sinks or floats.
If the object's density is less than the surrounding fluid, it will float.
The reason is that the fluid, which has the greater density, contains more mass/weight
in a given volume compared to the object.
The buoyant (upward) force, which equals the weight of the fluid displaced,
is thus greater than the weight of the object (downward force).

::: {.callout-warning}

The above statements about the physics of buoyancy are for background.
If you are confused, read through the statements carefully again.
Still confused? Move on to the section on Stoke's Law, which is more important in this module.

:::

The key point is that sinking or floating requires a **density difference**.

# Stoke's Law

Food scientists usually use Stoke's Law to reason about systems in which particles are
dispersed in a liquid.
This equation accounts for numerous factors relevant to food systems that can be controlled during processing.

We are interested in floating or sinking, which is characterised by a *velocity*.
This velocity is then a function of some set of physical parameters.
We know one already: *density difference*.
These changes also depend on gravity, which can be captured with the constant for gravitational acceleration.

To find the full set of parameters requires some knowledge of the real world.
Alternatively, if you are not the observant type, [play with the sliders to explore the effect of the parameters](https://edibotopic.github.io/stokes-law/).

The answers to the following should be obvious enough but if not expand the box below to confirm.

## Expand for Answers

Large stones fall quicker than small pebbles in water.

Things fall slowly in honey.

Clearly then, particle *diameter* and solvent *viscosity* must be considered.

:::

We can say then that the velocity is a function of particle diameter, density difference, gravitational acceleration and viscosity.

Some of these will `drive` the change and some will `resist` the change:

$$v = \frac{drive}{resist}$$

The viscosity is the only factor that resists the change.
Thus, velocity is proportional to the other parameters and inversely proportion to viscosity.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Writing the Equation with Some Educated Guesses

Based on what we know so far we can *guess* that velocity ($v$) is proportional
to particle diameter ($D$), density difference ($\Delta \rho$) and gravitational acceleration ($g$):
We can write this more succintly as:

$$v \propto (D,\Delta \rho,g)$$

We also know that viscosity ($\mu$) tends to resist floating and sinking (e.g., $v$ is inversely proportional to $\mu$). 

$$v \propto \frac{1}{\mu}$$

Putting this information together we have the following (incorrect) equation:

$$v â‰ˆ \frac{D \cdot \Delta \rho \cdot g}{\mu}$$

Why is this incorrect (?) â€” because the dimensions on the left don't match those on the right.
**You are strongly advised to check this yourself.**

The dimensions for $v$ are $[L T^{-1}]$ but the right gives $[T^{-1}]$.

Assuming we have identified the correct parameters, what can we do to correct the dimensions?

The most obvious solution is to square the diameter term, yielding:

$$v â‰ˆ \frac{D^2 \cdot \Delta \rho \cdot g}{\mu}$$

The equation now has all the correct terms: the velocity is proportion to the square of the
diameter, which is also known from experiments.

An empirical factor of $18$ is also usually included based on experimental observations:

$$v = \frac{D^2 \cdot \Delta \rho \cdot g}{18\mu}$$

## Importance to Processing

There are two contexts in which Stoke's Law becomes important in a food processing context.

1. Recovery of the dispersed phase to generate a product
2. Stabilising the dispersion to improve product quality

These two situations have opposing goals, but Stoke's Law helps in both cases.

### Recovery

If the goal is separation we can target parameters that increase sinking/floating velocity.

For example, particles can be aggregated/flocculated to increase their diameter.[^1] 

[^1]: This requires knowledge of the chemistry of a specific system

It is not possible to change gravity, but we can use centrifuges to apply an increased g-force.[^2]

[^2]: in such cases $g$ may be replaced with a term representing centrifugal force

When using a centrifuge an elevated temperature can be used to reduce viscosity; in this, way parameters can be manipulated simultaneously to achieve the desired effect.

::: {.callout-note}

We will discuss technology like centrifuges in more detail in later sections in the module. 
For now, it is sufficient to know that centrifuges accelerate sinking/floating by spinning a sample around a central axis at high speeds.

You are encouraged to look them up in the meantime if you want to know more.

:::

### Stabilisation

When the goal is stabilisation (preventing separation) a different approach is necessary.

Decreasing particle diameter will decrease separation velocity, and this can be achieved with homogenisation.

::: {.callout-note}

Homogenisers are covered in later sections â€” they force a dispersion through a narrow gap, which breaks dispersed particles into smaller-sized particles.

:::

When formulating the product â€” if appropriate â€” a thickener can be added to increase viscosity.

### Operations and their Inverses

There is sometimes confusion among students about situations in which an idea or equation
can be leveraged to achieve two opposing goals, in this case *separation* and *stabilisation*.
Of course, which operation we are interested in depends on *context* (what are you processing?
who are your customers?).
However, it is valuable to be able to apply an idea/equation in these different contexts, rather than being restricted to one.

In general, many operations ($O$) have an `inverse` ($O^{-1})$.
This is a useful mental shortcut for remembering multiple operations.

| $O$  | $O^{-1}$  | Examples  |
|---|---|---|
| heating   | cooling  | pasteurising/refrigerating   |
| drying   | rehydrating  | spray-drying/dissolution  |
| comminution   | aggregation  | mincing/granulation  |
| separation  | stabilisation  | filtration/homogenisation   |
| concentration  | dilution  | evaporation/washing  |

Can you think of other examples?

## Question

Your company is interested in recovering a plant protein from process waste.
Laboratory results show that the protein aggregates in the presence of calcium and that the aggregates sink.
Early tests indicate that the viscosity of the solution decreases at 50C.

Provide a clear rationale, using appropriate equations, for the design of an operation to recover the proteins.
