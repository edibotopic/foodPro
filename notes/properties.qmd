## Note

If there are any errors, ambiguities or omissions in these notes please let me know.

I can answer any questions you have in class or you can meet me during **office hours**.

Keep in mind that you will likely need to revisit notes during the year as the material is covered.

Foods are complex biochemical systems.
When processing foods it is often possible to *reduce* food to its physical properties.
The following are some important physical properties:

- Surface area
- Density
- Viscosity

## Productive Difference

When studying the world it is common to distinguish between qualities and quantities.
Quality refers to food properties that are subjectively evaluated, whereas quantities
are objectively counted or measured.
Both are critical in food processing but we will largely restrict ourselves to quantity.

This leads us to a further interesting distinction between intensive and extensive quantities.
An extensive property is one that reduces in magnitude when the size of a food is decreased.
On the other hand, if a hot food is split in two we do not expect the temperature of each half to be different.

A curious fact is that differences in intensive properties often lead to change.
These changes are often useful and are exploited in food processing.
This can be referred to as a *productive difference*.

## Transfer Equations

This module involves some mathematics but not a lot.
In general, mathematics is used to clarify a concept or provide a new way of thinking about an idea.

When there is a productive difference a change occurs.
This change usually involves some kind of transfer.

Such events can be described using transfer equations
of the following form, where $r$ can be taken as *transfer rate*:

$$r \propto k \cdot \frac{Drive}{Resistance}$$

We will encounter some equations of this form and the idea is simple:

> there are properties to control that drive change and
> properties to control that resist that change
